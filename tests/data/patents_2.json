                "The present application is related to a plant conveyor for grasping plants in a substantially upright orientation and moving them from a position to another position along a conveyor axis. The present application is also related to a method for harvesting plants grown in nursery beds when the plants are to be later transplanted.Many plants are first grown in nursery beds rather than planted directly. These are then removed from the beds and transplanted into field or forest land where the plants mature. One concern is that the plants' roots and stems are relatively undamaged when they are lifted from the nursery beds. Otherwise, root loss or stem damage can have an adverse effect on plant development.A number of harvesting apparatuses are available for harvesting or lifting plants that are subsequently to be transplanted. Some harvesting apparatuses can include plant conveyors. Some current conveyors include paired belts on a rail and pulley system mounted rigidly to a harvester frame. These paired belts grasp and move plants up and away from nursery beds. Then, the paired belts release the plants into a storage bin wherein they are gathered or stacked.The gap between each pair of belts can be kept at a distance wide enough for the plants to travel up the belts without stem damage but close enough so that the plants do not slip from the paired belt and drop to the ground. In existing systems, the gap between each pair of belts of current conveyors can only be adjusted mechanically by loosening bolts attaching the belt rails to the harvester frame and physically moving the rails closer together or farther apart.The present disclosure is directed to providing an improved conveyor and an improved method for harvesting plants.A conveyor according to embodiments of the present application includes a frame, at least two arms at least one of which is movably mounted to the frame, at least two rails wherein each rail is coupled to an end of one of said at least two arms, at least two belts wherein each belt is rotatably mounted on one of said at least two rails such that the belts are capable of engaging plants therebetween and moving the plants along a conveyor axis, and one or more bias members which are configured to bias said at least one movable arm toward the other one of said at least two arms. The conveyor of the present application further comprises an expanding mechanism which is configured to exert an outward force on said at least one movable arm upon engagement so that said at least one movable arm move away from another arm.A conveyor kit according to embodiments of the present application comprises a frame, at least two arms at least one of which is movably mountable to the frame, at least two rails wherein each rail is coupleable to an end of one of said at least two arms, at least two belts wherein each belt is rotatably mountable on one of said at least two rails such that the belts are capable of engaging plants therebetween and moving the plants along a conveyor axis, and one or more bias members which is capable of biasing one of said at least two arms toward the other one of said at least two arms. A conveyor kit of the present application further includes an expanding mechanism capable of exerting an outward force on said at least one movable arm upon engagement so that said at least one movable arm move away from another arm.A method for harvesting plants according to the present application comprises the steps of moving a body of soil containing plants onto a plant transport apparatus, engaging the one or more plants by paired belts to transfer the one or more plants between the paired belts, automatically adjusting a gap between the paired belts based in part on the diameter of the one or more plants by one or more bias members biasing at least one of the paired belts toward the other of the paired belts. A method for harvesting plants according to the present application further comprises the step of manipulating an expanding mechanism to expand the paired belts open, the expanding mechanism exerting an outward force to move one of the paired belts away from the other of the paired belts.A conveyor according to the present application has significant advantages. First, stem damage and plant jams can be greatly mitigated due to the arrangement of bias members and movable arms which enables the gap between each pair of belts to widen or narrow without user intervention to accommodate varied diameters of plants and allows the plants to freely flow through the conveyor. Second, when plant jams occasionally occur due to operators' errors causing plants to bunch together at the entry point into paired belts or running a harvester too deep and bringing soil into the belts, they can be easily and conveniently released by manipulating an expanding mechanism capable of exerting an outward force on each movable arm to move it away from a fixed frame and expand paired belts open.As shown in  and , a plant harvester  comprises a main frame , a plant transport apparatus , a conveyor , and root soil removers . The main frame  includes wheels  mounted on a moveable wheel frame. The wheel frame is mounted for selective reciprocation between a stowed position and an extended position. In the extended position, the wheels  are displaced into a downward position so that the harvester  can be towed behind a wheeled tractor or other engine driven vehicle by a hitch . In the stowed position, the wheels  are displaced into an upward position for plant lifting. The main frame  also includes a horizontal undercutting blade  which serves to sever an intact body of soil  containing plants  and their root structure . The position of the wheels  may be varied to adjust the blade depth required for lifting plants from the nursery bed. The width of the blade  is suitably sized to support the soil  of the seedling bed to minimize damage to the root structure  as the plants  are lifted from the nursery field and transferred to the plant transport apparatus .The plant transport apparatus  is suitably a smooth surface conveyor having a plurality of horizontal openings. One such plant transport apparatus  is suitably manufactured from a rod chain or slated belt driven by a hydraulic motor acting through a drive chain on a sprocket. The spacing between the rods or slats allows soil to pass through while supporting the seedling bed . The use of the transport apparatus  is critical to reduce damage to the plants . As configured, the seedling bed  is continuously supported from the point it is removed from the nursery bed until entry into the root soil remover . This is done to minimize root tip breakage and stem damage resulting from the downward pull on the plants  caused by the soil weight within the root system . Also, the support by the transport apparatus  allows a wider gap between the paired belts of the conveyor  to reduce stem damage because there is little risk of plant slipping from the paired belts. The plant transport apparatus  is suitably synchronized in a manner well-known in the art to the forward speed of the harvester  to minimize drag against the root portion  of the plants . During operation, it is preferable that the leading end of the plant transport apparatus  is disposed beneath the trailing edge of the blade  to facilitate smooth lifting and transfer of the cut seedling bed  from the blade  to the plant transport apparatus .In an embodiment, the conveyor  is suitably located adjacent the plant transport apparatus , and is positioned to transfer the plants  along a conveyor axis  that extends between the plant transport apparatus  and a stowage bin (not shown). The conveyor  is mounted on the main frame . The conveyor  comprises six pairs of belts , , , , , and . In order to meet a particular need of harvesting plants being sown in paired rows, every two pairs of belts are grouped together. Each pair of belts grasps the plants  in an upright orientation and moves them from a position before the seedling bed  exits the plant transport apparatus  to a point where the plants  enter the stowage bin. It is preferred to match the timing of movement of both the plant transport apparatus  and the conveyor  to minimize drag damage to the plants  being processed by the harvester . Detailed structures of an improved conveyor according to the present application will be descried below.Each root soil remover  includes a plurality of flexible probes . The root soil removers  are mounted for free rotation on axles . The motion of the root soil removers  is initiated by at least a portion of the plants  passing through the plurality of flexible probes . For instance, as the plants  is transported in the harvester  by the conveyor , the root portion  contacts the plurality of flexible probes  to cause the rotation of the root soil removers  on the axles . Note that the root soil removers  are not driven in the direction of plant travel by any mechanical means, such as a drive motor. As such, the free rotating nature of the root soil removers  minimizes drag on the plants  and root tips  during use. This is advantageous as reduced drag reduces damage to the roots .Operation of the harvester  may be best understood by referring to . The harvester  is towed behind a wheeled tractor or other engine driven vehicle (not shown) by the hitch . The plants  are shown growing in the ground in front of the harvester . The plants  are picked up including a body of soil  which has been severed by the blade . The soil body  containing the plants  is lifted onto the plant transport apparatus  by the forward motion of the harvester . The soil  and the plants  are conveyed along the plant transport apparatus  to a point where the stem portions of the plants  are engaged by the paired belts of the plant conveyor . As the plants  are propelled within the paired belts of the plant conveyor , they exit the end of the plant transport apparatus  where they gently engage the root soil remover . The motion of the plants  relative to the root soil remover  causes the rotation of the root soil remover . The plurality of flexible probes  of the root soil remover  flex in the direction of plant flow (shown by the conveyor axis ) to remove the soil . At the end of the paired belts of the conveyor , the plants  are discharged from the belts into the storage bin for sorting, counting, and subsequent packaging.The use of the plant transport apparatus  is capable of supporting the entire seedling bed from below and the root soil remover  help to reduce damage to the plants. However, the plants may still jam and sustain stem damage in the paired belts of the conveyor  due to variances in plant diameter. In addition, the gap between a pair of belts of the conveyor  can only be adjusted manually. The conveyor  also does not have a convenient and efficient way to release plant jams in the paired belts.depicts an embodiment of a conveyor assembly . The conveyor assembly  includes a pair of belts , a pair of rails , a pair of arms , a frame , one or more bias members , and an expanding mechanism . The paired belts  can be made of any suitable materials, such as rubber, chain links, and the like. The paired belts  are rotatably mounted on the pair of rails . The lower end of each arm  is fixed to the corresponding rail . The upper ends of the arms  are movably mounted to the frame . By way of example without limitation, the pair of arms  can pivot on points and , respectively. Optionally, one arm can be pivotably mounted to the frame , and another arm may be fixed to the frame . The one or more bias members  can be connected to the pair of arms . The one or more bias members  can be positioned above the pair of belts  and a certain distance away from the pair of belts  so as to allow plants to smoothly flow through the convey assembly . By way of example without limitation, the bias member  may be a linear spring connected to the pair of arms  (such as the spring shown in ), a torsion spring mounted at least one of the pivot points and , a rubber belt connected to the arms , or any other types of bias member. The arrangement of the bias member  and movable arms  allows the gap between the pair of belts  to widen or narrow without manual adjustment by a user (i.e., automatically) to accommodate varied sizes of plants. This automatic adjustment of gap width can reduce stem damage and plant jams in the paired belts . Positioning the pivot points and at the upper ends of the arms  also facilitates plants to freely flow through the conveyor assembly  without jamming.The expanding mechanism  can be connected to the pair of arms . The expanding mechanism  is configured to exert an outward force on the pair of arms  so that one arm moves away from the other. By way of example without limitation, the expanding mechanism  may include a rotabable cam  and a rod  which is engaged by the ratable cam. When the cam is rotated, an outward force can be exerted on the arms  by the rod . In this way, the pair of arms  can move away from each other, whereby expanding the paired belts  open. The arrangement of the expanding mechanism  allows any plant jams in the paired belts  to be released easily and without having to remove the one or more bias members .A conveyor may comprise one or more conveyor assemblies . The number of conveyor assemblies included in a conveyor and the spacing between adjacent conveyor assemblies may be varied according to particular needs of harvesting operation. By way of example without limitation, for the purpose of harvesting seedlings which can be planted in beds containing six rows spaced eight inches apart, a conveyor may be configured to include six conveyor assemblies spaced approximately eight inches apart. A conveyor may also include any other number of conveyor assemblies according to particular needs. When a conveyor includes a plurality of conveyor assemblies, they can share a common frame. At least one arm of each conveyor assembly can be movably mounted to the common frame. One or more bias members can be mounted to each pair of arms. The one or more bias members may be mounted above each corresponding pair of belts and positioned a certain distance away from the corresponding pair of belts so as to allow plants to flow through the conveyor.As mentioned above, plants can be sown in a nursery bed in paired rows for efficiency. In order to satisfy the particular need, two pairs of belts can be grouped together.  show another embodiment of a conveyor assembly of the present application. A conveyor assembly  include two pairs of belts  and , two pairs of rails  and , a fixed frame , two movable arms , two supporting members , a plurality of bias members , and an expanding mechanism . The expanding mechanism  is capable of expanding the movable arms  open so as to release plant jams. The two pairs of belts  and  are rotatably mounted on the two pairs of rails  and , respectively. Two interior belt rails and are fixed to a lower beam member  of the fixed frame . In this way, each conveyor assembly  or  has one movable arm . The movable arms  may be pivotably mounted to a pair of upper transverse members  of the fixed frame .As shown in  and , the fixed frame  comprises the lower beam member , an upper structure , and the pair of upper transverse members . A pair of mounting members  is located at the two ends of the lower beam member  respectively. Each mounting member  contains two slots adjacent to its two ends respectively. The pair of mounting members  is used to fix the two interior belt rails and to the lower beam member . Optionally, the two interior belt rails and can be fixed to the lower beam member  by any other suitable means, such as by welding. The upper structure  comprises two vertical beams and , and one diagonal beam  which, in the example depicted in , are oriented in a “Z” shape. The lower ends of the two vertical beams and are fixed to the lower beam member  by any suitable means, such as welding. The upper ends of the two vertical beams and are fixed to the pair of upper transverse members  by any suitable means, such as welding. Three aligned apertures  are formed in the three beams of the upper structure  respectively so that a shaft  of the expanding mechanism  can go through them. Two pairs of apertures are formed at the two ends of the pair of upper transverse members , and each pair of apertures is used to pivotally mount the corresponding movable arm .As shown in , each movable arm  includes a lower beam  and an upper structure  which is perpendicularly fixed to the lower beam . A pair of mounting plates  is located at the two ends of each lower beam  respectively, and they are used to fix a corresponding outside belt rail or to the lower beam . Optionally, each lower beam  may be fixed to the corresponding outside belt rail by any other suitable means, such as by welding. The upper structure  comprises two vertical beams and , and a diagonal beam  which, in the example depicted in , are oriented in a “Z” shape. The lower ends of the two vertical beams and are fixed to the lower beam member  by any suitable means, such as welding. A flange  is located at the upper end of each vertical beam or . Each flange  is drilled with an aperture which corresponds to the aperture formed at the either end of the upper transverse member . Each flange  is pivotally mounted to the corresponding end of the upper transverse member  by a loose bolt . Optionally, the movable arms  may be pivotally mounted to the upper transverse member  by any other suitable means. In virtue of this arrangement, each arm  is movable relative to the fixed frame  so as to allow the corresponding outside belt rail to move with respect to the corresponding interior belt rail.As shown in , each supporting member  comprises a vertical surface  and a horizontal surface . Each supporting member  can be formed integrally or by welding two pieces together. The vertical surface  of each supporting member  is fixed to the two vertical beams , , and the diagonal beam  of the corresponding movable arm  by any suitable means, such as welding. Several slots  are located in the horizontal surfaces  of the pair of supporting members . The slots  can be used to mount one or more bias members  to the supporting members . In the embodiment depicted in , the one or more bias members  are in the form of linear springs. The supporting members  and the one or more bias members  are positioned above and away from the belt rails  and  to allow plants to pass through the conveyor assembly . The supporting members  and the one or more bias members  are located below and adjacent to the expanding mechanism .In normal operation, the bias members  apply an inward force on the movable arms  to bias them toward the fixed frame  so that the outside belt rails and are biased toward the corresponding interior belt rails and while still permitting the gap between each pair of belts to vary according to varied diameters of plants. The ability of the gap between the paired belts to vary while still biasing one belt rail toward another belt rail permits the paired belts to convey plants of various sizes while mitigating plant damage caused by the grasp of the paired belts and plant jams in the paired belts. The number and locations of the one or more bias members  may be varied according to the particular needs. While the one or more bias members  are depicted in  as linear springs, the one or more bias members  may be any other types of bias members capable of biasing the movable arms  toward the fixed frame , such as rubber belt.As shown in , the expanding mechanism  is positioned above and adjacent to the supporting members  and the bias members . The expanding mechanism  includes a handle , a shaft , two pairs of cams , two pairs of rods , two pairs of compressible members , two pair of chambers , the two pairs of bars , and the two pairs of ball bearings . The handle  is connected to the shaft . The shaft  is coupled to the cams . As mentioned above, the shaft  is configured to go through the three aligned apertures  formed in the vertical beams and and the diagonal beam  of the fixed frame . The cams  engage with the corresponding rods . The rods  are coupled to the movable arms  by any suitable means. By way of example without limitation, a groove  can be formed at one end of each rod . The groove  may engage with a corresponding protrusion  which is fixed to the movable arm . The compressible members  are encased in the corresponding chambers  and coupled to the corresponding bars . While the compressible members  are depicted in  as springs, they may be any other types of compressible members capable of being released to create an outward force. The ball bearings  are positioned at one end of the corresponding bars . Also, the ball bearings  are attached to the corresponding movable arm .A user can manipulate the expanding mechanism  to apply an outward force on the movable arms  to overcome the inward tension applied on the movable arms  by the bias members  and expand the movable arms  open so as to release plant jams in the paired belts  and . When the handle  is rotated, a first outward force is exerted on the rods  by the corresponding cams . The rods  apply the first outward force to the movable arms , whereby moving the movable arms  away from the fixed frame . Accordingly, the two outside belt rails and move away from the two interior belt rails and , thus expanding the paired belts  and  open. The compressible members  can facilitate to expand the paired belts  and  open. In normal operation, the compressible members  are compressed in the corresponding chambers . The movement of the movable arms  under the first outward force exerted by the rods  can release compression of the compressible members , thereby applying a second outward force on the bars . The second outward force is exerted on the movable arms  by the ball bearings , whereby facilitating to move the moveable arms  away from the fixed frame  and expand the paired belts  and  open. Expanding the paired belts  and  open by manipulating the expanding mechanism  permits any plant jams to be released more easily and without having to remove any of the bias members  which bias the outside belt rails and toward the interior belt rails andThe arrangement of the compressible members  can also facilitate to bias the movable arms  and automatically adjust the gaps between the paired belts  and  according to varied diameters of plants. Under the combined action of the inward tension by the bias members  and the outward force by the compressible members , the movable arms  can be more smoothly biased to accommodate various sizes of plants. In addition, as shown in , thread is formed on each bar . A nut  can be installed on the corresponding bar . The length of the bar  outside the chamber  can be adjustable by rotating the nut . In case that there appears a gap between the ball bearing  and the movable arm , a user can manually adjust the nut  in order to increase the length of the bar  outside the chamber , whereby attaching the ball bearing  to the movable arm .show an illustrative example of the expanding mechanism . In another embodiment, there may be two handles  which are positioned at either end of the fixed frame  respectively. In this way, a user can activate the expanding mechanism  to expand the paired belts open at the front side or the back side of the conveyor assembly  by turning either handle . This arrangement increases the convenience of manipulating the expanding mechanism . In a further embodiment, the expanding mechanism  may be configured to expand the movable arms  open at one or more locations rather than two locations as shown in  by decreasing or increasing corresponding number of the structure comprising cams, rods, compressible members encased in chambers, bars, and ball bearings. Added cams may be attached to the single shaft  which is connected to the handles . Thus, the paired belts can be expanded open at more locations by turning either handle  for one time. Optionally, the expanding mechanism  may adopt any other suitable structures which are capable of exerting an outward force on the movable arms  to overcome the inward tension on the movable arms  by the bias members  and expand the paired belts open so as to release plant jams.The number of the conveyor assembly  included in a conveyer and spacing between adjacent conveyor assembly  may be varied according to particular needs of harvesting operation. By way of example without limitation, a conveyor included in a harvester may comprise three conveyor assemblies with certain spacing between adjacent conveyor assemblies. The structure of each conveyor assembly can be similar to the structure of the conveyor assembly  described above. Each conveyor assembly include two movable arms, one or more bias members, and an expanding mechanism. The three conveyor assemblies can share a pair of upper transverse members of the fixed frame . The fixed frame  further include two outside supporting members which are used to fix the conveyor to a main frame of the harvester. The outside supporting members can be configured into any shapes or structures which are suitable to fix the conveyor to the main frame. By way of example without limitation, the outside supporting members may be oriented in a “Z” shape. In addition to being used in a seedling harvester, a conveyor according to the present application can be used to any other circumstances in which there are needs to grasp crops, vegetables, other plants, or other things in a substantially upright orientation and to move them from a position to another position along a conveyor axis.Operation of the aforementioned harvester including three conveyer assemblies  is described here. The harvester also includes a blade, a plant transport apparatus, and one or more root soil removers. When the harvester is in use, it can be towed behind a wheeled tractor or other engine driven vehicle by means of a hitch. Optionally, the harvester may be integrated with a tractor. After a body of soil containing plants is severed by a blade and lifted onto a plant transport apparatus, the body of soil containing plants is conveyed along the plant transport apparatus to a point where the stem portions of the plants are engaged by the paired belts of the plant conveyor. Once the paired belts engage the stem portions of the plants, the movable arms of the conveyor are biased by the corresponding bias members to acquire a desirable gap between each pair of belts according to the varied diameters of the plants. The ability of the gap between each pair of belts to be adjusted automatically to accommodate varied diameters of the plants can not only significantly reduce stem damage and plant jams, but also it can save the trouble of manually adjusting the gap between each pair of belts. When plant jams occasionally occur, they can be easily and conveniently released by a user manipulating the corresponding expanding mechanism. When the handle of the corresponding mechanism is turned, a first outward force by the rods is exerted on the corresponding movable arms. Meanwhile, a second outward force by compressible member is also applied the corresponding movable arms. The first and second outward forces expand the corresponding movable arms and the belt rails attached to the movable arms open. The ability of expanding each pair of belts open allows any plant jams in the paired belts to be released easily and efficiently. The harvester including the conveyor assembly  overcomes the aforementioned weaknesses of the harvester  depicted in  and other current harvesters.depicts an embodiment of a method  for harvesting plants by using a harvester including a conveyor of the present application. At block , after a blade severs a body of soil containing plants, the body of soil with the plants is lifted onto a plant transport apparatus. The use of the plant transport apparatus capable of supporting the body of soil containing plants from below can reduce damage to the plants. This is done to minimize root tip breakage and stem damage resulting from the downward pull on the plants caused by the soil weight. Also, little risk of the plants slipping from paired belts of a conveyor due to the support by the transport apparatus allows a wider gap between the paired belts of the conveyor (such as the example shown in ); therefore, the paired belts do not have to tightly grasp the plants, whereby significantly reducing plant stem damage. At block , the soil and plants are engaged by the paired belts of the conveyor in order to be transferred along a conveyor axis. The plants are transferred along the plant transport apparatus to a point where the opposite sides of a plant stem are engaged by the paired belts of the conveyor. At block , the gap between each pair of belts is automatically adjusted to accommodate varied diameters of the plants by one or more bias members capable of biasing at least one movable arm toward the other arm of a conveyor assembly. The bias member may be a linear spring, a torsion spring, a rubber belt, or any other suitable bias members capable of biasing at least one movable arm toward the other arm of each conveyor assembly. This configuration of at least one biased movable arm of each conveyor assembly allows the gap between each pair of belts to vary in order to accommodate various sizes of plants. The ability of automatically adjusting the gap between each pair of belts according to varied diameters of plants is advantageous to mitigate plant damage and plant jams and save the trouble of manually adjusting the gap between paired belts. When desirable gaps between the paired belts are available, the plants are grasped by the paired belts in a substantially upright orientation and moved along a conveyor axis from a position before the plants exits the plant transport apparatus to another position where the plants enter a stowage bin.The method  may further include the step of manipulating an expanding mechanism to release plant jams. Plant jams can occur at times, such as when plants bunch together at the entry point into the paired belts or when the harvester cuts the soil too deep and soil enters the belts. By manipulating the expanding mechanism, any plant jams can be easily released. The expanding mechanism can adopt any suitable structures which are capable of exerting an outward force on movable arms of the conveyor to overcome the inward tension by the bias members and expand the movable arms and corresponding paired belts open. By way of example without any limitation, the expanding mechanism may comprises a handle, a shaft, two pair of cams, two pairs of rods, two pairs of compressible members encased in two pair of chambers, two pairs of bars, and two pairs of ball bearings. The handle is connected to the shaft and the cams. The cams are coupled to the rods. The rods engage the corresponding movable arms. The two pairs of springs are compressed in the chambers and coupled to the bars. The ball bearings are positioned at one end of the corresponding bars, and are attached to the corresponding movable arm of the conveyor. By turning the handle, a first outward force is applied to the rods by the corresponding cams. The first outward force is exerted to the corresponding movable arms by the rods, whereby expanding the corresponding movable arms and paired belts open. Meanwhile, the compressible members can exert a second outward force on the corresponding bars and ball bearings, whereby facilitating to expand the corresponding movable arms and the belt rails attached to the movable arms paired belts open. Expanding the paired belts of the conveyor open enables any plant jams in the paired belts to be released conveniently.The method  may further comprise the step of removing plant root soil by one or more root soil removers after the plants exit the plant transport apparatus and while they are propelled within the paired belts of the conveyor. Preferably, the one or more root soil removers are not driven by any mechanical means, such as a drive motor. Each root soil remover includes a plurality of flexible probes, and is capable of freely rotate in the direction of plant travel.

                "This application is the US National Stage for International Application No. PCT PCT/US12/39739, filed on May 25, 2012, which itself is related to and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/491,018 filed May 27, 2011.This invention relates generally to a drive for the sickle of a header of an agricultural cutting machine, such as a combine, windrower or other crop harvesting machine, or a mower, and more particularly, to a drive mechanism having only a pivotally rotating drive shaft extending upwardly from an upper enclosure thereof for connection to a knife head, and which is configured to have a profile shape when viewed from the side that tapers convergingly toward a forward end thereof, so as to be adapted to be disposed in or below a floor or pan of the header, to reduce interference with plant material flow.The disclosure of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/491,018, filed May 27, 2011, is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.Sickles typically including cutter bars supporting a row of knives, have been used to cut plants, including, but not limited to, hay, grasses, small grains and the like, for many years. The knives are composed of a plurality of knife or sickle sections which are mounted in side by side relation forming an elongate metal knife assembly. The elongate knife assembly is normally supported so as to slide longitudinally along an elongate stationary bar that has forwardly projecting, spaced apart guards bolted to a structural beam. The knife assembly moves back and forth in a reciprocating movement to move the knives relative to the guards so that the leading knife edges of the knives cross over the guards or through slots in the guards. This produces a shearing or cutting action which severs plant stems and stalks or other material captured between the knives and the guards.In a harvesting machine, such as a combine or windrower, the knife assembly and stationary bar are typically supported in connection with a cutting head or header, and are oriented so as to extend sidewardly along a forward edge portion of structure such as a floor or pan of the header, hereinafter sometimes referred to generally as the floor. The floor or pan defines the lower periphery of a cut crop or plant flow area, which can include conveying apparatus, such as one or more augers or belts, operable in cooperation with a reel in machines so equipped, for conveying the cut plant material and crops, for instance, to a feeder inlet of a combine or windrow forming apparatus of a windrower.The knife assembly is driven reciprocatingly longitudinally by an oscillating drive, which can include, but is not limited to, an eccentric shaft on a rotating hub, a wobble drive, or a similar well known commercially available device. Such drives are typically located at the sides of the header, so as to drive the knife assembly from the end. This location is advantageous as it allows the driving point for the knife assembly to be in line with the stationary bar, provides clearances for removal of the knife assembly, and provides space for assembly of the drive. Disadvantages of the side location include that the header must include significant frame structure for supporting the drive and to withstand forces and vibrations generated thereby. The end structure or crop divider at the end of the header must also be relatively wide, to accommodate the drive and to direct adjacent standing crops therepast, and increasing the possibility of accidentally pushing down adjacent standing crops. Additionally, for headers utilizing two drives located on opposite sides of the header, it is usually desired to time the operation of the drives such that the forces and vibrations generated by the respective drives cancel one another. This typically involves relatively long mechanical drive lines connecting the two drives together, which is disadvantageous as it adds weight, cost and complexity.A knife assembly, which will weigh from 35 to 38 pounds for a typical 20 foot wide header, typically must accelerate and decelerate two times per cycle as a result of the reciprocating movement. A typical speed for the knife assembly is up to about 16 hertz or cycles per second. Thus, it can be seen, the reciprocating motion at a high cycle per second generates high acceleration values and high deceleration values that in turn generate high forces on the structural components. These high forces can have at least two negative effects, vibration at the drive system that may be transmitted to other components of the machine, and fatigue failure of the structural components themselves. On larger headers, for instance, headers 30 feet wide and greater, two knife assemblies each equal to one-half the sideward extent of the header are often used.Driving a knife assembly or assemblies of a header from a more central location, such as the center of the header, would provide several advantages compared to a side location. Notably among these advantages, the header structure would not be required to support heavy drive units on one or both sides, such that the structure of the header could be lighter. Long timing apparatus extending between the ends could also be eliminated. If the drive mechanism could be incorporated into a location that would not interrupt or require dividing crop or plant material flow through the crop flow area of the header, the normal crop flow of the header would not be significantly impacted. And, since the drives are not located in the ends, the end dividers can be made significantly thinner, such that the header can have a shorter overall width, would be more easily maneuverable in relation to adjacent standing crop, and danger of downing the adjacent standing crop would be reduced.Reference Priepke U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,810,304; 7,805,919; 7,730,709; 7,520,118; and 7,401,458, and Bich et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,011,272, which demonstrate that a sickle drive or drives can be incorporated in or below the header floor to solve one or more of the problems set forth above in regard to end mounted drives and interruption of plant material flow in the crop flow area of the header.What is sought is a sickle drive adapted to be incorporated into or below the floor of a header of a plant cutting or harvester to reduce interruption and splitting of plant material flow, and which overcomes one or more of the shortcomings and limitations set forth above.What is disclosed is a sickle drive adapted to be incorporated into or below the floor of a header of a plant cutting or harvester to reduce interruption and splitting of plant material flow, and which overcomes one or more of the shortcomings and limitations set forth above.According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the drive includes a generally flat enclosure having a forward end and bounding and defining a cavity. The drive is preferably configured as an epicyclic arrangement, including a rotatable first input element supported in the cavity for rotation about a generally upstanding first rotational axis. The drive includes a first eccentric element supported in the cavity for rotation by the first input element in eccentric relation to the rotational axis. The drive includes a first drive arm disposed preferably at least partially in the cavity and having a first end and a second end opposite the first end, the first end being connected to the eccentric element for rotation about a first eccentric axis therethrough eccentrically about the first rotational axis. The first drive arm preferably extends in a first sideward direction from the first end relative to the first rotational axis to the second end, and the second end pivotally connects eccentrically to a first pivot element supported for rotation about a generally upstanding first pivotal axis, such that, in operation, the first pivot element will be pivoted about the first pivotal axis by the rotation of the first end of the first drive arm about the first rotational axis. The pivot element is configured for connection or mounting of a knife arm thereto, for connecting to a first sickle knife assembly extending forwardly thereof, such that operation of the drive will reciprocatingly move the first sickle knife assembly sidewardly relative to the enclosure.According to another preferred aspect of the invention, the input element, eccentric element and the drive arm are each relatively flat, and the latter two are substantially vertically coextensive, for vertical compactness, such that the drive is adapted to be unobtrusively positioned below or in the front region of the floor of a header, to allow relatively unhindered plant material flow thereover.According to still another preferred aspect of the invention, the drive includes a rotatable second input element supported in the cavity for rotation about a generally upstanding second rotational axis, preferably in side by side relation to the first input element. The drive includes a second eccentric element supported in the cavity for rotation by the second input element in eccentric relation to the second rotational axis. The drive includes a second drive arm preferably at least partially disposed in the cavity and having a first end and a second end opposite the first end thereof, the first end of the second drive arm being connected to the second eccentric element for rotation about a second eccentric axis therethrough and eccentrically therewith about the second rotational axis, the second drive arm extending in a second sideward direction opposite the first sideward direction from the first end thereof to the second end thereof. The second end of the second drive arm pivotally connects eccentrically to a second pivot element supported for rotation about a generally upstanding second pivotal axis, such that the second pivot element will be pivoted about the second pivotal axis by the rotation of the first end of the second drive arm about the second rotational axis. A second knife arm is preferably connected to or mounted on the second pivot element and is configured for connecting to a second sickle knife assembly extending forwardly thereof, for reciprocatingly moving the second sickle knife assembly sidewardly relative to the enclosure.As another preferred aspect of the invention, the first drive arm extends sidewardly across and forwardly of the second input element, and the second drive arm extends sidewardly across and rearwardly of the first input element. Alternatively, the drive arms of each of the drives can extend in opposite sideward directions, that is, away from the other of the drives, so that they do not cross. As still another variation, the drives can be configured such that the drive arms extend more forward and rearward, as opposed to sidewardly.As still another preferred aspect of the invention, the first input element and the second input element are connected together for joint rotation in opposite rotational directions, for reciprocatingly moving the first and second sickle knife assemblies sidewardly simultaneously in opposite directions. This is advantageous as opposite forces generated by the operation of the drive will at least largely cancel each other. As a further preferred aspect of the invention, a rotatable power source or input is connected in rotatably driving relation to either the first input element or the second input element, for jointly driving them in the opposite directions. The power source can comprise, for instance, a fluid or electric motor, drive shaft, belt drive, chain drive, or the like.The enclosure can fully contain the drive or drives, for instance, by including full upper and lower covers, or it can partially enclose the drive or drives, such that all or a portion of any of the elements are exposed. For instance, as a non-limiting example, the enclosure can include or be incorporated in or below the floor of a header of a plant cutting machine which will serve as a cover, with all or a portion of a bottom region of the drive or drives, or elements thereof, exposed to the ground below, essentially the frame of the header then generally defining the lower bounds of the cavity.As an advantage of the invention, the long drive arms have been found to provide a smoother cyclical cutting action for the sickle knives, close to a pure sinusoidal motion. And by crossing the drive arms, a more compact package is achieved.Turning now to the drawings wherein a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown, in , a conventional, well known agricultural cutting machine, which is a combine , is shown including a header . Header  is shown supported in the conventional, well-known manner on a forward end  of combine , and is operable for cutting or severing crops such as, but not limited to, small grains such as wheat and soybeans, and inducting the severed crops into a feeder  for conveyance into combine  for threshing and cleaning, in the well known manner, as combine  moves forwardly over a field.Header  includes a pan or floor  which is supported in desired proximity to the surface of the field during the harvesting operation, and an elongate, sidewardly extending sickle  along a forward edge portion  of floor , sickle  being operable for severing the plants or crop for induction into header , as will be explained. Header  additionally includes an elongate, sidewardly extending reel  disposed above sickle  and rotatable in a direction for facilitating induction of the severed plant material or crops into header . Here, header  is configured as a draper type, having a system of elongate, flat, sidewardly moving draper belts  and  having upwardly facing surfaces disposed just rearwardly of forward edge portion , operable in cooperation with reel  for conveying the severed plant material or crops toward an inlet opening of feeder  for induction into combine , in the well-known manner.Referring more particularly to , sickle  extends in a sideward direction along the width of floor , between a first side edge portion  of the floor, and an opposite second side edge portion . Sickle  includes an elongate, sidewardly extending first cutter bar assembly , and an elongate, sidewardly extending second cutter bar assembly  extending in end to end relation to cutter bar assembly , cutter bar assemblies  and  being supported in substantially longitudinally aligned relation adjacent to forward edge portion  of floor .Referring more particularly to , cutter bar assemblies  and  each include a plurality of sidewardly facing aligned slots  through a sidewardly extending array of guards  which project forwardly from a stationary bar  at sidewardly spaced intervals therealong. Stationary bar  extends the length of sickle  just forwardly of forward edge portion  of floor , and guards  are mounted to bar  with fasteners . Bar , in turn, is mounted to a frame  of header  adjacent to forward edge portion  by fasteners , as best illustrated in . Each of cutter bar assemblies  and  supports an elongate knife assembly  for reciprocating longitudinal movement within slots , each knife assembly  including a row of knife sections including oppositely facing, angularly related knife edges  which, in conjunction with adjacent guards , effects a shearing or cutting action which severs plant stems and stalks or other material captured between the knives and the guards as the knife sections are reciprocatingly moved sidewardly, as denoted by arrow A in .As noted above under the Background Art heading, it is desirable to reduce negative effects of the reciprocating sideward motion of knife assemblies , including, but not limited to, vibration, fatigue failure, and the like, and also the disadvantages of known structures for effecting the motion, including the need for substantial structure for supporting drive mechanisms on the sides of headers, the increased width of side dividers containing the mechanism, and apparatus for timing drive mechanisms located on opposite sides of a header.Reduction of these negative effects and disadvantages is achieved according to the present invention by utilizing first and second low profile sickle drives A and B constructed and operable according to the teachings of the present invention, for reciprocatingly driving the respective knife assemblies . First and second sickle drives A and B are illustrated in  at a center location on header  between side edge portions  and , although it should be noted that it is contemplated that sickle drives A and B could alternatively be utilized at other locations on a header, and that multiple sickle drives  could be used at multiple locations on a header.First and second sickle drives A and B are packaged together in a low profile common enclosure . Enclosure  is configured so as to be integrated into or beneath floor  of header , in, or just rearward of, forward edge portion , as best shown in , to facilitate both smooth flow of crop or plant material thereover, and also smooth passage over the ground surface  therebelow. In this latter capacity, it can be observed that enclosure  is desirably configured to have a tapered profile shape when viewed from the side, preferably including an upper cover , and a lower cover  to allow disassembly, and which extend generally convergingly toward a forward end  of the enclosure. Also preferably, the forward end of lower cover  will have an upwardly curving shape, to guide and facilitate the smooth passage over the ground surface and flow of plant material thereabout. It can be observed that forward edge portion  of floor  has an upwardly curved shape, which combined with the upwardly tapered or curved forward end of enclosure , provides header  with an overall wedge shaped leading edge profile, which again, facilitates the smooth flow over the ground and of plant material over the front edge of the header. Enclosure  can be mounted in any suitable manner, such as by attachment with fasteners to frame or structural elements of header .As shown, upper cover  of enclosure  is located below forward edge portion  of floor , which can comprise sheet metal or other suitable material, such that cut plant material will flow over the enclosure without contacting it. Alternatively, upper cover  can be integrated into floor . Enclosure  will be of cast and/or machined metal construction such as steel or aluminum, and upper and lower covers  and  can be joined together with suitable fasteners, as illustrated in subsequent figures. A skid plate  can be disposed below at least the forward end, for protection from wear and contact with hard objects such as rocks and the like that may be encountered during operation.Each of first and second sickle drives A and B includes a knife arm  atop upper surface  of enclosure  and extending forwardly therefrom. Knife arms  pivotally connect to the knife assemblies , respectively, and are movable by the respective drive A or B in a sideward pivoting action that will translate via a pivoting relationship into the above described sideward reciprocating movement, as restrained by the guards . Knife arms  are the only upwardly externally protruding elements of first and second drives A and B, the other elements being located within an internal cavity  of enclosure . Knife arms  project forwardly through slots  in forward edge portion , to minimize interruption of the plant material flow.Referring also to , the internal elements of first and second drives A and B other than knife arms  are disposed in side by side relation in an internal cavity  of enclosure . First and second drives A and B are each configured as an epicyclic arrangement, including a central rotatable input element, an eccentric element rotatable along an epicyclical orbit about the rotatable input element, and a pivoting drive arm moved by the eccentric element to pivot the knife arm in the side to side direction. More particularly, first drive A includes a rotatable first input element  supported in an upper region of cavity  for rotation about a generally upstanding first rotational axis . Drive A includes a first eccentric element  supported in cavity  below first input element  for rotation thereby in eccentric relation to first rotational axis  about a generally upstanding first eccentric axis  laterally offset relative to rotational axis , such that eccentric element  will follow an epicyclical path  about rotational axis . Drive A includes a first drive arm  disposed in cavity , having a first end  and an opposite second end . First end  is rotatably connected to eccentric element  for rotation therewith along epicyclical path  () about first rotational axis . First drive arm  extends in a first sideward direction from first end  to second end . Second end  pivotally connects to a pivot arm  connected eccentrically to a pivot shaft  of a first pivot element  supported for rotation about a generally upstanding first pivotal axis  therethrough. Pivot shaft  extends upwardly through an aperture  through upper cover  of enclosure  and fixedly connects to a knife arm , e.g., via a splined connection or the like.In operation, rotation of first input element  will cause first eccentric element  to orbit eccentrically along epicyclical path . First drive arm , because it has a fixed length and is attached at one end to first eccentric element  and at the other end to pivot arm , can only move generally longitudinally, with first end  also orbiting along path  about rotational axis  while also rotating about eccentric axis . This, in combination with the ability of pivot arm  and pivot shaft  of element  to only pivot about pivotal axis , results in limited pivotal movement of second end  of drive arm  and pivot arm  along an arcuate path about axis . Because knife arm  is fixedly connected to the upper end of pivot shaft , it will be limited in movement to an arcuate path A, as shown in . Additionally, because the opposite end of knife arm  is connected to a knife assembly , knife assembly  will be reciprocatingly moved sidewardly an amount A relative to guards , to effect the plant cutting action. In this regard, the connection of knife arm  to knife assembly  is preferably a pinned connection such that knife assembly , or that portion thereof in proximity to knife arm , will also move along the pivotal path, such that some limited fore and aft movement of the knife assembly will occur, as denoted by distance B in . The relationship between the guards and knife assembly can be configured to allow this. Alternatively, the connection between the knife head and knife assembly can be configured, e.g., slotted connection, to allow some limited fore and aft relative movement, such that the knife assembly only moves sidewardly.Second drive B includes a rotatable second input element  supported in an upper region of cavity  for rotation about a generally upstanding second rotational axis , beside first input element . Drive B includes a second eccentric element  supported in cavity  below second input element  for rotation thereby in eccentric relation to second rotational axis  about a generally upstanding second eccentric axis  laterally offset relative to rotational axis , such that eccentric element  will follow an epicyclical orbital path  about rotational axis , as shown in . Drive B includes a second drive arm  disposed in cavity , having a first end  and an opposite second end . First end  is rotatably connected to second eccentric element  for rotation therewith about second eccentric axis  in eccentric relation to, and about, second rotational axis . Second drive arm  extends in a second sideward direction opposite the first sideward direction from first end  relative to second rotational axis  to second end . Second end  pivotally connects to a pivot arm  connected eccentrically to a pivot shaft  of a second pivot element  supported for rotation about a generally upstanding second pivotal axis  therethrough. Pivot shaft  extends upwardly through an aperture  through upper cover  of enclosure  and fixedly connects to a second knife arm , again via a splined connection or the like.In operation, in the same manner as for drive A, rotation of second input element  of drive B will cause second eccentric element  to orbit eccentrically along epicyclical path . Second drive arm , because it has a fixed length and is attached at one end to second eccentric element  and at the other end to pivot arm , can only move generally longitudinally, with first end  also orbiting along path  about rotational axis  while also rotating about eccentric axis . This, in combination with the ability of pivot arm  and pivot shaft  of element  to only pivot about pivotal axis , results in limited pivotal movement of second end  of drive arm  and pivot arm  along an arcuate path  about axis . Because the second knife arm  is fixedly connected to the upper end of pivot shaft , it will be similarly limited in movement.Referring particularly to , epicyclical orbital path  of eccentric element , eccentric axis  and first end  of drive arm  about rotational axis  of input element  is shown. Also shown is limited arcuate path  of second end  of drive arm  and pivot arm  of pivot element  about pivot axis , and the resulting arcuate path A of knife arm  about axis . The points X, Y and Z represent the eccentric movements of first end  of the drive arm along the epicyclic path , and the translated pivotal movements of second end  of the drive arm, pivot element  and knife arm  along arcuate path , resulting from rotation of input element  about rotational axis , as denoted by arrow R. This will result in the attached knife assembly being reciprocatingly moved in the same manner as described above.It is desired to reciprocatingly move the two knife assemblies  simultaneously in opposite sideward directions. To achieve this, first and second drives A and B are preferably operated in opposite direction, in timed relation. This is preferably accomplished by jointly driving the drives in opposite rotational directions. In the preferred configuration shown, first and second input elements  and  are connected together via enmeshed gears  and  which extend therearound, respectively. Alternatively, input elements  and  could be connected together by a cogged belt, a timing shaft, or the like, and the eccentric axes  and  offset to provide opposite directional movements of drive arms  and .To rotate input elements  and , a rotatable power source or input  is provided, which is preferably an electric or fluid motor, connected in driving relation to one of the input elements  or  via a bevel gear arrangement  or the like, although power input  is contemplated to also represent a shaft, belt, or chain drive, as desired. Here, power input  is mounted to housing  at an acute angle to the forward direction. Also, it can be observed that input elements  and  are offset in the fore and aft direction. These enable accommodating power input  in a manner to provide a shorter overall fore and aft extent of the drives.As a feature of the invention, to provide a relatively thin, flat overall package, input elements  and , eccentric elements  and , and drive arms  and  of drives A and B are each relatively flat, and the eccentric elements and drive arms are substantially vertically coextensive, to provide vertical compactness, such that drives A and B are adapted to be unobtrusively positioned below or in the front region of floor  of a header, such as header , to allow relatively unhindered plant material flow thereover. In this regard, input elements  and  are each preferably disk or platter shaped elements supported for rotation about axes  and , respectively by suitable bearings , the inner races of which are connected to enclosure  by threaded fasteners  which serve as mounting shafts. This configuration provides input elements  and  sufficient mass to serve as flywheels for the drives. Also, input elements  and  overlap portions drive arms  and , respectively, to facilitate fore and aft compactness.Eccentric elements  and  are fixedly connected to the respective input elements  and  for rotation therewith via keyed shafts . Drive arms  and  are mounted about the respective keyed shafts  via bearings  for rotation thereabout, the eccentric elements and drive arms being held vertically together by threaded fasteners . The opposite ends of arms  and  connect to pivot arms  and  via clevis joints including bearings  to allow relative rotation or pivoting action. Pivot shafts  and  are supported for rotation in apertures  and , respectively, by bearings , and strap bearings  retained by fasteners . An upper seal  seals the apertures from the elements. Upper and lower covers  and  are fastened together by fasteners  at spaced locations therearound. Power input  is also attached with fasteners . The splined portions of knife arms  and upper ends of pivot shafts  and , respectively, are held together by fasteners , in a clamping action.It can be observed that drive arms  and  are several times longer than the diameters of epicyclical paths  and  of the first or driven ends of the drive arms, here, on the order of at least about 4 times longer. The result of this will be pivoting movements of the drive arms in a manner such that the fore and aft movements of the first ends of the drive arms as they follow their epicyclical paths about the rotational axes of the input members will be relatively large, but will translate into only small fore and aft movements of the second ends and the pivot arms about the pivotal axes. The relatively long drive arms are advantageous, as they translate the eccentric rotational motion into close to a sinusoidal motion of the knives, which is desired for smoothness and cutting ability. The side to side movements of the second ends and pivot arms will be relatively long, corresponding to the diameters of the epicyclical paths. As another advantage, fore and aft forces, denoted by arrows FFA in , exerted against the pivot arms will be effectively minimal, while the sideward forces, denoted by arrows FS, will be maximized. These forces FS are also transmitted substantially longitudinally along the drive arms, and the drive arms act to push and pull longitudinally against pivot arms  and , which, as another advantage, make the drives robust and strong. As still another advantage, because the two drives are oppositely moving, external forces and resulting vibrations generated by the drives in both the sideward and fore and aft directions, are largely canceled. As another advantage, the configuration of drives A and B, and packaging in a single enclosure , allows pivot shafts  and , and also the pivotal connections between the drive arms and pivot arms, to be of relatively large diameter, so as to be robust and strong. Here, it should be noted again that although the drive arms are depicted herein and arranged in crossing fashion, they can alternatively extend in opposite sideward directions, away from the other drive, or in more of a fore and aft extending orientation. Still further, although the drives described and depicted have the input elements above the drive arms, it should be understood that this is non-limiting and that the vertical arrangement of the parts can be reversed or rearranged if desired or required for a particular application.As yet another advantage, it can be observed that the sickle drive, including the enclosure and rotatable power source or input, can have an overall vertical extent that facilitates placement in or below the floor of a header of a plant cutting machine, such that only the knife arms protrude upwardly from the floor. In this regard, it can be observed that power input  is no greater in height than the enclosure , and is located directly behind it, to facilitate the incorporation of the drives in or under the floor of the header, which is an important advantage of the invention. Alternatively though, it should be understood that it is contemplated according to the invention that more or less of the apparatus can be located above or below the floor of the header, as desired or required.In light of all the foregoing, it should thus be apparent to those skilled in the art that there has been shown and described a low profile sickle drive. However, it should also be apparent that, within the principles and scope of the invention, many changes are possible and contemplated, including in the details, materials, and arrangements of parts which have been described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention. Thus, while the foregoing description and discussion addresses certain preferred embodiments or elements of the invention, it should further be understood that concepts of the invention, as based upon the foregoing description and discussion, may be readily incorporated into or employed in other embodiments and constructions without departing from the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the following claims are intended to protect the invention broadly as well as in the specific form shown, and all changes, modifications, variations, and other uses and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention are deemed to be covered by the invention, which is limited only by the claims which follow."

                "This application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/962,254, filed on Oct. 31, 2013 and U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/995,196, filed on Apr. 3, 2014, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.1. Field of the InventionAspects of the present invention relate to a device for holding lines for trimming plant life. In particular, there is a device for holding lines in a holder secured around garden equipment.2. BackgroundWithout limiting the scope of the invention, the present background is described in connection of storing spare grass/weed trimmer lines for the ease of the operator to retrieve. Grass/weed trimmers are the most popular machines used in areas where larger machines such as mowers are not able to go, such as ditches and hillsides. Grass/weed trimmers use a consumable monofilament type of line to accomplish trimming areas of lawn, parks, or any grassy area to be groomed. The trimmer line is constantly being abraded during the operation of the grass/weed trimmer. Many of these grass/weed trimmers require the operator to manually replace the line once the line can no longer cut. In any case, obtaining replacement line is a frequent and inconvenient occurrence which makes the operator unorganized and inefficient.Accordingly, there is a need to solve this problem through means of a line holder which may be secured around the shaft of the grass/weed trimmer where it would hold a supply of individual strands of replacement trimming line. Further, it is desirable to have a trimmer line holder which enables each line to be measured and cut to a desired length prior to replacing the exhausted trimmer line to the grass/weed trimmer head. This will keep the operator organized and efficient.Prior devices have attempted to solve the problems discussed above. For example, there are described devices having a tubular housing with two clamps on both ends that would be affixed onto the shaft of a grass/weed trimmer; or containers carrying replacement trim lines that are otherwise attached to weed trimmers. Although the devices may do the job intended, these devices are bulky and in the way of the operator, and further fail to conveniently hold individually retrievable lines, therefore constricting the flow of movement of the operator.As such, a need does exist for a holding device which provides a means to store a supply of individual replacement line that would be attainable instantly for the use of the operator. There is also a need to secure a holding device in the field both quickly and easily, where the device is not in the way of the operator.Embodiments of the present invention provide a line holding device for storing spare replacement trimmer line, comprising a housing or body affixed onto an object such as the shaft of the grass/weed trimmer. The housing or body is configured as a collar with a certain sized bores or apertures running through the collar, providing a channel for the replacement trimmer line to go through. The replacement trimmer line is positioned to be readily exposed and available for the operator to use.According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is a line holder comprising: a hollow body having an outer surface and an inner surface, a first surface at a first distal end, and a second surface at an opposite second distal end; a plurality of longitudinal bores passing through the body from the first surface to the second surface, wherein each of the plurality of bores is configured to receive and hold an individual line; and at least one fastener to secure the body to an object; wherein the inner surface is configured to contact the object.In another embodiment of the present invention there is a line holder comprising: a collar shaped body, the body having an outer surface and an inner surface, a first surface at a first distal end, the first surface defined from an outermost edge of the outer surface at the first distal end toward an edge of the inner surface at the first distal end, and a second surface at an opposite second distal end, the second surface defined from an outermost edge of the outer surface at the second distal end toward an edge of the inner surface at the second distal end, wherein the body is separable into two segments; a plurality of longitudinal bores passing through the body from the first surface to the second surface, wherein each of the plurality of bores is configured to receive and hold an individual line; a pair of flanges on each of the body segments, wherein the pair of flanges on a first body segment is aligned with the pair of flanges on the second body segment so as to form a first aligned set of flanges and a second aligned set of flanges; and a fastener configured to secure the body segments together through at least one of the aligned set of flanges, thereby locking the two body segments together and securing the body around an object.The line holder can be of different sizes with bores or channels that would provide a space for small monofilament trimmer line for non-commercial use to larger monofilament line for commercial industrial use. The bores are configured along a straight axis and having a diameter such that the inserted line is retained without falling out yet easily removed when needed. Since monofilament trimmer line normally has a bend, the trimmer lines become naturally locked into the bores/channels making the lines difficult to fall out while the trimmer is in use, but easy enough for the operator to retrieve with ease when needed.A body segment or half of the line holder may be secured onto an object by one or more fasteners. In an embodiment, a screw is used on each side of body that secures the body segments or body halves around the shaft of a grass/weed trimmer and or the handle of a string trimmer mower. The body halves can also be secured together around the shaft with a variety of fasteners such as screws, ties, Velcro straps, clamps, clips, or other attachment mechanisms.The object around which the line holder is secured about can have a cylindrical-like structure or a component such as a shaft of garden equipment. In another embodiment, the line holder may be configured to be attached to the operator.Embodiments of the present invention can be constructed from different materials such as and not limited to different types of plastics, polymers, polystyrene, ABS, nylon, synthetic materials, resins, rubber, silicone, light metals, as well as from wood or leather and combinations thereof.Besides being used for gas fueled trimmers and electric grass trimmers, embodiments of the invention can also be used for a string trimmer mower. Embodiments of the invention can also be of different sizes to hold the different sized line monofilaments from lite commercial to industrial.These and other embodiments of the present invention are further made apparent, in the remainder of the present document, to those of ordinary skill in the art.The description above and below and the drawings of the present document focus on one or more currently preferred embodiments of the present invention and also describe some exemplary optional features and/or alternative embodiments.

                "This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/243,323, filed Apr. 2, 2014, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/807,376, titled CONTROL ARRANGEMENT AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING A POSITION OF A TRANSFER DEVICE OF A HARVESTING MACHINE and filed Apr. 2, 2013, each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.The present invention pertains to a control arrangement for controlling a position of an adjustable transfer device of a harvesting machine.Forage harvesters are used in agriculture to harvest plants from a field, to chop them and to unload them by means of an adjustable transfer device onto a container of a transport vehicle that drives on a side of the forage harvester. The position of the adjustable transfer device, normally arranged in the form of a spout, can be controlled by an operator by means of inputs on a hydraulic handle and actuators, normally hydraulic cylinders, in order to move the adjustable transfer device into a position in which the crop is unloaded onto the container of the transport vehicle, but not onto the ground. Usually, the adjustable transfer device can be rotated around a vertical axis, tilted around a horizontal axis to adjust the height of its outer end, and an end flap can be rotated in order to define the exhaust direction of the crop.Since the control of the adjustable transfer device is exhausting for the forage harvester operator, automatic solutions have been proposed for controlling the transfer device that use data on the relative position of the harvesting machine and the container, or a optical image capture device with an image processing system. The latter however are not always able to identify the container correctly, in particular when a field is opened, i.e. the forage harvester harvests a first strip of the field with standing crop on both sides such that the transport vehicle needs to follow the forage harvester, and the container to be filled is towed behind a tractor following the forage harvester, such that the distance between the forage harvester and the container is relatively large.A harvesting machine comprises a crop receiving header, a crop processing unit for processing crop received from the header and an adjustable transfer device for unloading processed crop onto a container of a transport vehicle. A control arrangement for controlling a position of the adjustable transfer device of the harvesting machine includes a optical image capture device or camera mounted on the harvesting machine. The optical image capture device has a field of view and an image signal output connected to an image processing system. The control arrangement further comprises an electronic control unit connected to an output of the image processing system. At least one actuator for adjusting the position of the adjustable transfer device is controlled by the electronic control unit. At least one sensor for sensing the actuator-controlled position of the adjustable transfer device has a signal output connected to the electronic control unit. Further, a display unit and an user interface connected to the electronic control unit.The electronic control unit is operable to perform or execute the following steps:(a) to display an image of the container captured by the optical capture device overlaid with a symbol representing, for example, but not limited to, a predetermined location of the container, such as a front edge, or incidence of crop flow ion the container, on the display unit,(b) to calculate a position of the spout relative to a predetermined location of a container and an expected point of incidence of crop flow on a container within the field of view of the optical image capture device based upon a sensor signal from at least one sensor and an output signal of the image processing system,(c) to receive adjustment inputs from the user interface for adjusting the position of the actuator and thus of the adjustable transfer device and to update the position of the symbol overlaid on the image on the display unit according to the altered sensor output;(d) to receive a confirmation input from the user interface once the symbol in the image on the display is in an appropriate position with respect to the displayed image of the container in order to fill the container with crop, and to derive at least one feature in the image representing the container; and(e) to subsequently track the container within the output signal of the image processing system based on the image feature retrieved in step (d) and to control the actuator accordingly to fill the container with crop.A combination of two agricultural machines shown in  comprises a self-propelled harvesting machine  in the form of a forage harvester () and a transport vehicle  () in the form of a self-propelled tractor, which, by way of a tow bar  pulls a trailer , which comprises a container .The harvesting machine  has a frame , which is carried by front-driven wheels  and steerable rear wheels . The harvesting machine  is operated from a driver's cabin , from which an operator can see a harvesting attachment , in the form of a corn header attachment, which is affixed to an entry channel  on the front side A of the forage harvester . Crop plants  harvested from a field  by way of the harvesting attachment  are conveyed to a cutter head  via a gathering conveyor (not shown) with pre-compression rollers (not shown) located in the entry channel . The cutter head  acts in this embodiment as a crop processing unit for processing the crop plants  received from the harvesting attachment , hence chops them into small pieces and delivers them to a discharge accelerator . A post-processing device  with two kernel processing rollers (not shown) is located removably in the crop flow between the cutter head  and the discharge accelerator . The post-processing device  can be moved into an inoperative position in case that it is not needed, for example for a grass harvest, or entirely removed from the harvesting machine .The driving of the aforementioned drivable units of the harvesting machine  and the harvesting attachment  takes place by way of a combustion engine . The crops discharged from the discharge accelerator  exit the harvesting machine  to the container  that can be moving behind, as shown in , or alongside the harvesting machine , via an adjustable transfer device  in the form of a discharge spout , which can be rotated around an approximately vertical axis by way of a first actuator  and can be adjusted at a tilt angle by way of a second actuator . The discharge direction can be changed by way of a flap , the angle of which can be adjusted by way of a third actuator .The transport vehicle  and the trailer  with the container  have a conventional structure. The transport vehicle  comprises front, steerable wheels  and rear, driven wheels , which are supported on a carrying structure , which carries a driver's cabin .show the harvesting machine  and the transport vehicle , respectively, in side views. One can see that the harvesting machine  drives over the field  in a forward direction A, which is in  to the left, in order to harvest the crop plants . The transport vehicle , , follows behind the harvesting machine  in a forward direction B. This situation occurs when a field  is opened, for example when only an entry to the field is available at the center of a side edge of a field , such that there is no possibility for the transport vehicle  to drive alongside the harvesting machine  without damaging crop plants . During subsequent passes over the field , the transport vehicle  can drive on a harvested part of the field  on the left or right side of the harvesting machine . The harvesting machine  then moves along an edge of crops, which represents a border between a harvested area of the field  and the still standing plant population consisting of crop plants  on the field , and is reaping the crop plants . The transport vehicle  is then thus moving on the harvested part  of the field, parallel to the harvesting machine , along a path on which the crop plants  chopped by the harvesting machine  arrive at the container  by way of the adjustable transfer device . The transport vehicle  must therefore always move parallel next to the harvesting machine .The harvesting machine  is steered by a driver sitting in the driver's cabin  or by a steering device, which operates automatically. The transport vehicle  is equipped with a steering device so as to facilitate or automate the parallel movement relative to the harvesting machine , and which can be omitted. The harvesting machine  could also be any other self-propelling harvesting machine, such as a potato or beet harvester.The harvesting machine  is equipped with a first position-determining device , which is located on the roof  of the cabin . A first radio antenna  is also positioned there. The transport vehicle  is equipped with a second position-determining device , which is located on roof  of the cabin . A second radio antenna  is also located there.Now turning to , which is a top view of the harvesting machine (forage harvester)  opening a field by harvesting and chopping the crop plants  from a section of the field as it moves forward. The forage harvester  then unloads the chopped material through the spout  to a container  (e.g., cart) pulled by the transport vehicle  (e.g. tractor), which is following behind the harvesting machine .In , the distance D of the harvesting machine (forage harvester)  and the transport vehicle  can be variable, and the spout  needs to be adjusted so the material coming out from the spout  will land in the container . In addition, the transport vehicle  path might not be perfectly aligned with the forage harvester , and the spout  also needs to be adjusted to take into account the left/right offset.Now, reference is made to , in which among other things, the individual components of the position-determining devices , , an electronic control unit , actuators , ,  for the adjustment of the adjustable transfer device  and discharge spout , sensors , ,  for the detection of their actual position and the steering devices of the transport vehicle  () and the harvesting machine  () are schematically shown. Electronic control unit  includes a processor and memory. Operating and executable software are stored in memory and executed by the processor. Sensor  detects the position of the adjustable transfer device  around the vertical axis, as adjusted by actuator . Sensor  detects the tilt position of the adjustable transfer device , as adjusted by actuator . Sensor  detects the angular position of the flap , as adjusted by actuator . Some of the above mentioned components are also illustrated in .Now turning to , the first position-determining device  is on board the harvesting machine  and comprises an antenna  and an evaluation circuit , which is connected to the antenna . The antenna  receives signals from satellites of a position-determining system, such as GPS, Galileo, or Glonass, which are supplied to the evaluation circuit . With the aid of the signals of the satellites, the evaluation circuit  determines the actual position of the antenna . The evaluation circuit  is also connected to a correction data-receiving antenna , which receives radio waves radiated from reference stations at known locations. With the aid of the radio waves, correction data for the improvement of the accuracy of the position-determining device  are produced by the evaluation circuit . The evaluation circuit  transmits its position data by way of a bus line  to a control device .The control device  is connected via an interface  to a reception and transmission device , which is in turn connected to the radio antenna . The reception and transmission device  receives and generates radio waves, which are picked up and radiated by the antenna .Analogously, the second position-determining device  is located on board the transport vehicle . The second position-determining device  comprises an antenna  and an evaluation circuit , which is connected to the antenna . The antenna  receives signals from satellites of the same position-determining system as the antenna , which are supplied to the evaluation circuit . With the aid of the signals of the satellites, the evaluation circuit  determines the actual position of the antenna . The evaluation circuit  is also connected to a correction data-receiving antenna , which receives radio waves radiated from reference stations at known sites. With the aid of the radio waves, correction data for the improvement of the accuracy of the position-determining device  are generated by the evaluation circuit .By way of a bus line , the evaluation circuit  transmits its position data to a control device . The control device  is connected via an interface  to a reception and transmission device , which in turn is connected to the radio antenna . The reception and transmission device  receives and generates radio waves, which are picked up and radiated by the antenna . By the reception and transmission devices ,  and the radio antennae , , it is possible to transmit data from the control device  to the control device  and vice-versa. The connection between the radio antennae ,  can be direct, for example, in a permissible radio range, such as citizen's band radio, or something similar, or made available via one or more relay stations, for example, if the reception and transmission devices ,  and the radio antennae ,  work according to the GSM or the UMTS standard or another suitable standard for mobile telephones.The control device  is connected to a steering device , which controls the steering angle of the front, steerable wheels  of the transport vehicle . Furthermore, the control device  sends speed signals to a speed specification device , which, via a variation of the engine rpm of the transport vehicle  and/or the gear transmission, controls the speed of the transport vehicle . Moreover, the control device  is connected to a permanent storage unit .On board the harvesting machine , the control device  is connected to the electronic control unit , which, together with the actuators , ,  it controls and the sensors , ,  connected to it, forms a control arrangement for the control of the transfer of the crops from the harvesting machine  to the container  of the transport vehicle . The electronic control unit  is connected to a steering device , which controls the steering angle of the rear, steerable wheels . Furthermore, the electronic control unit  sends speed signals to a speed specification device , which, via a variation of the gear transmission, controls the propelling speed of the harvesting machine . The electronic control unit  is also connected to a throughput sensor , which detects the distance between the pre-compression rollers in the entry channel , with a sensor for the detection of the position of sensing arms  placed on a divider tip of the harvesting attachment ; a permanent storage unit , via valve devices (not shown) with the actuators , , and  and with sensors , , , which respectively detect the position of one of the actuators , , and , and with an optical image capture device , which is placed more or less in the middle of the adjustable transfer device  on its left or right or underside A (), and during the harvesting operation, is aligned on the container  and is preferably implemented as a stereo-camera having two lenses  and two image sensors (not shown) arranged one above the other or side by side. The electronic control unit  receives the signals from the optical image capture device  via an image processing system  that processes the image signals from a signal output of the optical image capture device  in order to extract the position of features of the container  within the field of view  of the optical image capture device .Further, the electronic control unit  is connected to an user interface A mounted in the cabin . The user interface A comprises a display unit  and an user interface with keys , which could also be complemented or replaced by a touch-sensitive display unit A. Another user interface B with at least one key  is provided on a hydraulic handle  (not shown) that is pivotally mounted and coupled with a sensor  connected to the electronic control unit  in order to receive manual propelling speed commands by the operator in the cabin . Some of the above mentioned components are also illustrated in .Operation of the electronic control unit  are schematically shown in . Now turning to , after start in S, i.e. after a harvest operation switch (which might be one of the keys  or another key, not shown, on a dashboard in the cabin ) of the harvesting machine  is switched on, and the operation of the electronic control unit  is initialized, step  follows. In step , it is checked whether a container search command was received from the user interfaces A, B (), thus from a key  or a key  assigned to input the desire of the operator to locate a container  at a position where it is difficult to locate by the optical image capture device . Such a position is, in particular, the position behind the harvesting machine  and the transport vehicle , as shown in , since the container  is relatively far away from the optical image capture device . Under certain circumstances, as bad visibility or a container  having a color similar to the color of the field , it can however also be useful and possible to input a container search command when the container  is alongside the harvesting machine .If the result of step S is “no,” step S follows. In step S, it is checked whether the adjustable transfer device  is in a rear unloading position according to the signal of the sensor . If this is not the case, step S is executed, in which the electronic control unit  controls actuators , ,  according to the signal from the optical image capture device , processed by image processing system . This means that in the image from the optical image capture device , features are identified, for example the upper edge  of the container  (), and the actuators , ,  are controlled such that the crop flow expelled by the adjustable transfer device , hits the interior of the container . A feedback for the impact point of the crop plants  on the container  can be derived from the image signal from the optical image capture device . Further, since the optical image capture device  is a stereo camera, its signals allow to estimate a distance between the harvesting machine  and the container  and the height of the upper edges  of the container  over ground, such that the actuators ,  and  can be controlled according to a known kinematic model of the free crop flow downstream the adjustable transfer device .On the other hand, if the result in step S or S is “yes,” the electronic control unit  proceeds with step S. This step and the following ones are used to find a container  in the image of the optical image capture device  in difficult cases, such as a rear unloading situation shown in , in which it is not easy for the electronic control unit  to identify the container  in the mentioned image.In step , the electronic control unit  calculates a position of an expected point of incidence of the crop flow on the container , if it is within the field of view  of the optical image capture device  (). The calculation first identifies the container  in the field of view  in an image captured by the optical image capture device . Next, expected points of incident within the container  are calculated based on the captured image. Thus, if no container  is in the field of view  of the optical image capture device , the process terminates here and goes back to step S. If on the other hand a container  is in the field of view  of the optical image capture device , the position of an expected point of incidence of the crop flow on the identified container  is calculated, based upon the sensor signal in order to learn the direction of the crop flow after leaving the adjustable transfer device , and based on an output signal of the image processing system , since the electronic control unit  needs to know the distance between the harvesting machine  and the container  in order to derive the expected point of incidence. The distance between the discharge spout  of harvesting machine  (or the machine  itself, e.g. the rotation point of the discharge spout  around the vertical axis) and the front edge A of the container  can be derived from the signal of the image processing system  since the optical image capture device  is a stereo camera. If the optical image capturing device  were a monocular camera, the size (pixels) of the near edge of the container  in the image could be used as an estimate for the mentioned distance. Additionally or instead, the mentioned distance can be derived from position data of the harvesting machine  using the position-determining device  and a position of the transport vehicle  transmitted by the radio antennas , . The orientation of the spout  based on position of actuator , , or  is used to determine the path of crop flow.In step S, the known model kinematic of the free crop flow downstream the adjustable transfer device  is applied, like in step S, to calculate where the crop flow would theoretically intersect top plane of the container  opening. This position can be calculated in absolute coordinates, for example using the position data from the first position-determining device , or in relative coordinates with an origin for example at the rotation point of the adjustable transfer device  around the approximately vertical axis.Step S is followed by step S, in which an image of the container  is shown on the display unit  together with a symbol  () representing alignment of spout  with front edge A of container  that coincides with the calculated expected point of incidence of the crop flow on the container discussed above. In other words, the crop flow will intersect the calculated expected point of incidence when symbol  is aligned with front edge A of container . The image can be non-processed, i.e. directly come from the optical image capture device , or be pre-processed by the image processing system  in order to remove unimportant details and to emphasize, for example by adding color or changing brightness, features identified in the image that might resemble the container .In step S, the electronic control unit  checks whether a confirmation input was received via an assigned one of the keys  and/or  from the user interface A, B. By depressing the key, the operator in the cabin  can confirm that according to his or her opinion the symbol in the image on the display unit  is in an appropriate position with respect to the displayed image of the container  to fill the container  with crop (). This confirmation input could also be input by means of a touch-sensitive display unit A or orally or by a suitable gesture detector. Thus, if the result of step S is “no,” it can be assumed that the symbol  shown on the display unit  is outside the image of the container .In this case, step S follows in which the electronic control unit  can receive adjustment inputs from the user interface (by means of keys  and/or ) for adjusting the position of one or more of the actuators , ,  and thus of the adjustable transfer device . The electronic control unit  thus controls the position of the actuators ,  and/or . Step S is followed again by step S, in which a new image is taken by the optical image capture device , and by step S, in which the position of the symbol  in the image on the display unit  is updated according to the output of the sensors , , , which is now changed due to the movement of one or more of the actuators , , . In the situation where symbol  is not aligned with front edge A of container  (.), the operator can move symbol  in alignment with front edge A of container  thereby actuating actuator  to rotate spout  into position aligned with container  for rear unloading in which the symbol  is located on the display unit  aligned with the image of front edge A of the container  (). The adjustment of the symbol  to the front edge A of the container  can be performed, if necessary, in the horizontal direction and in the vertical direction, be it simultaneously or subsequently, dependent on the operator's choice or as provided by an automated system. Another embodiment of the present invention considers the container  being pulled on a side of the harvesting machine  where the symbol  can be adjusted to align with the upper lateral edge of the container  or a side opening thereof. Other embodiments of the present invention can accommodate container orientations relative to the harvesting machine , whether the container is aft, forward, or along-side of the harvesting machine , and any feature of the container  within the field of view of the optical capture device .On the other hand, if the operator has confirmed in step S that the symbol  in the image on the display unit  is in an appropriate position with respect to the displayed image of the container  (.) to fill the container  with crop, step S is executed, in which the control unit  derives at least one feature in the image representing the container. This is relatively easy, since the container  can be assumed to be in close vicinity to symbol . The electronic control unit  thus uses in step S the known position of the symbol and suited features in the vicinity of the symbol  in the image. The electronic control unit  can identify the upper edges A of the container  in the image. The identified feature is preferably highlighted in the image on the display unit , for example by color or brightness.In the following step S, the electronic control unit  tracks the container  within the output signal of the image processing system  based on the image feature retrieved in step S and controls the actuators , ,  in a suitable manner, as described with respect to step S, in order to fill the container  with the harvested crop without spilling significant amounts of crop onto the ground. In step S, actual images can be shown on the display unit  (), like in step S, in order to inform the operator about the position of the container  as detected by the electronic control unit  (preferably highlighting the detected and tracked feature of the container ) and the expected location of the crop impact point on the container  by means of the symbol .can be summarized as follows:S: StartS: Container Search Command Received (key )S: Adjustable transfer device  in Rear Position (Sensor )S: Control Actuators , ,  according to signal from image capture device (e.g., camera) .S: Calculate a position of the spout  (or transfer device) relative to a predetermined location of a container and an expected point of incidence of the crop flow on a container within the field of view of the optical image capture device based upon the sensor signal and on an output signal of the image processing system.S: Display an image of the container  together with a symbol  on the display unit representing the alignment of spout  with front edge A of container , which is coincident with the calculated expected point of incidence of the crop flow on the container. Though Step  is presented chronologically or sequentially following Step , one embodiment of the present invention (not illustrated) provides for Step  to precede Step .S: Confirmation input from the user interface received to confirm that the symbol in the image on the display is in an appropriate position with respect to the displayed image of the container to fill the container with crop?S: Receive adjustment inputs from the user interface for adjusting the position of the actuator(s) , ,  and control the actuator(s) , , .S: Derive at least one feature in the image representing the container .S: Track the container  within the output signal of the image processing system based on the image feature retrieved in step S and control the actuator(s) accordingly to fill the container  with crop.Now turning to  that can be summarized as follows:S: Start.S: Rear Unload Command from User Interface.S: Position spout automatically for rear unloading. Any commercially available software that performs the automated spout positioning function can be incorporated into the present invention. Electronic control unit  receives the rear unload command from the user interface A. The ECU  manipulates actuators , ,  to position the spout  into a known orientation that is reasonable for rear unloading. Sensors , ,  provide feedback to the ECU  to close the feedback loop on the orientation of the spout .S: Image showing a visual alignment indicator  (e.g., cross hairs, cross or target as shown in ) to be aligned with front edge A of the container. The visual alignment indicator is created in the electronic control unit . The visual alignment indicator  is overlaid on top of the image from the camera  and streamed to the display unit  that the operator sees. Ideally, the operator would maneuver the spout  of the harvester  such that the visual alignment indicator  is pointed to the front edge A of the contain  and press a button to engage the system. The system would then identify the front edge A of the container  and track its position.S: Confirmation of input from operator (Yes or No)S: If S indicates no confirmation of input from operator, then spout adjustments are made and repeat S.S: If S indicates confirmation of input from operator, then the tracking algorithm automatically chooses salient features to be used for tracking the front edge A of the container . The salient features are unique regions in the images that are on the front side of the container .S: Track features and actuate spout. Once the salient features on the front side of the container  are selected, the crosshairs  could either disappear from the overlay or the software could automatically adjust the crosshairs  to point at the center of the front edge A of the container .It will become apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, one or more functions of the electronic control unit  can be provided by separate electronic control units, not shown. In steps S and S, control of the adjustable transfer device  can be augmented according to a relative position of the container  with respect to the harvesting machine  derived from position data of the harvesting machine  using the position-determining device  and a position of the transport vehicle  transmitted by the radio antennas , .Now turning to  to illustrate one embodiment of the tracking processes of the present invention for rear unloading.Block : Indicator , such as cross hairs (), are aligned with the front edge A of the Container .Block : Stereo Camera captures the salient features from the video () and 3-D data near the front edge A of the container  and use it as the tracking template.Block : The relative location of the front edge A of the container with respect to the forage harvester  is computed from the 3-D stereo measurement of the salient features. The salient features of the front edge A are identified automatically by the tracking algorithm based on unique appearance or shape.Block : The horizontal direction, tilt and flap of the discharge spout is adjusted based on the relative location of the front edge A with respect to the forage harvester .Block : A check is performed whether the rear unloading process is terminated by the operator. If the check is “Yes,” then the process continues to Block  and the procedure to done. If the check is “No,” then the process continues to Block  to capture a new image from the camera of the container and the process returns to Block  for continued processing.Now turning to  for an alternative embodiment of the present invention that utilizes position measuring devices on both the harvesting machine and transporting vehicle to assist the optical capture device in measuring the relative motion between the harvesting machine (forage harvester)  and transport vehicle  of .Block : An indicator , such as a cross hairs, is aligned with the front edge A of the container () and spout  is adjusted to align with the front edge A of the container  as discussed above.Block : A stereo camera  () captures the salient features from the video and 3-D data near the front edge A of the container and use it as the tracking template.Block : A series of steps are performed:Compute the relative location of the front edge A of the container with respect to the forage harvester  from the 3-D stereo measurement of the salient features.Compute the relative location Xof the forage harvester  and the transport vehicle  based on their GPS coordinates from their respective GPSs , .Compute the relative location Xof the first edge A of the container  to the transport vehicle  from the GPS coordinates and the 3-D stereo measurements of the salient features of the front edge A of the container  (relative location Xis an offset computed once in this step).Block : Start Unloading Material, if not already started;Block : New GPS coordinates of the forage harvester  and transport vehicle  are received and combined with the relative location Xof the container  with respect to the transport vehicle  to get the relative location (X+X) of the container  with respect to the forage harvester .Block : Align cross hair of indicator  and spout  accordingly to maintain accurate discharge of the material into container .Block : A check is performed to determine whether the rear unloading process is terminated by the operator. If check is “Yes,” then the process continues to Block . If check is “No,” then the process returns to Block  to continue the process.While the disclosure has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the embodiments. Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure cover the modifications and variations of this disclosure provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents."
