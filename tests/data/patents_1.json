                "It is recognized that sufficient downforce must be exerted on a planter row unit to ensure the desired furrow depth and soil compaction is achieved. If excessive downforce is applied, especially in soft or moist soils, the soil may be overly compacted which can affect the ability of germinating seeds to break through the soil. If insufficient downforce is applied, particularly in hard or dry soil, the planter may ride up and out of the soil resulting in insufficient depth of the furrow.In the past, coiled springs extending between the parallel arms of the row units of the planter (see ) were often employed to provide the additional or “supplemental” downforce needed to ensure the desired furrow depth and soil compaction was achieved. By positioning the spring at various preset locations along the parallel arms, the amount of downforce exerted on the row unit could be increased or decreased. However, the amount of supplemental downforce exerted by the spring remained constant until the spring was repositioned. For example, when the planter encountered hard or dry soil such that greater supplemental downforce is necessary to maintain furrow depth or the desired soil compaction, the operator had to stop and adjust the location of the spring in order to increase the supplemental downforce. Furthermore, during operation, as the seed or fertilizer in the hoppers was dispensed, the weight of the row unit gradually decreased causing a corresponding reduction in the total downforce on the gauge wheels, because the supplemental downforce exerted by the spring remained substantially constant until the spring was manually repositioned.More advanced supplemental downforce systems, such as disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 12/679,710 (Pub. No. US2010/0198529) by Sauder et al. (hereinafter “the Sauder '710 Application”), which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, measure the strain in a member of the gauge wheel adjusting mechanism to determine the force being exerted against the gauge wheels to determine the downforce. A central processor or controller actuates the hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders, airbags or other actuators to increase or decrease the supplemental downforce across all the row units. While such systems may serve their intended purpose, they can be more costly because they require central processing circuitry as well as hydraulic or pneumatic valves, load sensors, and associated cable harnesses at each row unit in order to properly maintain the desired downforce. Moreover, the required processing steps increase the response time of such a system as compared with the use of coil springs or other earlier mechanical systems for supplying supplemental downforce. In addition, central control systems that apply a common supplemental downforce to each row unit fail to respond to unique loads experienced by each row unit, such that insufficient or excessive supplemental downforce may be applied to any given row unit.Thus, there is a need for a supplemental downforce control system that maintains a desired downforce at each row unit and additionally allows an operator to set the desired downforce from the tractor cab while on-the-go during planting operations.Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views,  illustrates a side elevation view of a single row unit  of a conventional row crop planter such as the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,009,668, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. As is well known in the art, the row units  are mounted in spaced relation along the length of a transverse toolbar  by a parallel linkage , comprised of upper and lower parallel arms ,  pivotally mounted at a forward end to the transverse toolbar  and at their rearward end to the row unit frame . The parallel linkage  permits each row unit  to move vertically independently of the toolbar  and independently of the other spaced row units in order to accommodate changes in terrain or upon the row unit encountering a rock or other obstruction as the planter is drawn through the field.The row unit frame  operably supports a seed hopper , and a smaller hopper  for insecticide and/or fertilizer, a seed meter  and a seed tube  as well as a furrow opener assembly  and furrow closing assembly . The furrow opening assembly  comprises a pair of furrow opener discs  and a pair of gauge wheels . The gauge wheels  are pivotally secured to the row unit frame  by gauge wheel arms . A furrow depth adjusting member  adjustably positions the gauge wheels  relative to the furrow opener discs  for establishing the desired furrow depth. A coil spring  is disposed between the parallel arms ,  to provide supplemental downforce to ensure that the furrow opener discs  fully penetrate the soil to the desired depth as set by the depth adjusting member  and to provide soil compaction for proper furrow formation. Rather than a coil spring, supplemental downforce may be provided by actuators or other suitable means such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,389,999 to Duello, U.S. Pat. No. 6,701,857 to Jensen, in European Patent No. EP0372901 to Baker, and/or the Sauder '710 Application.In operation, as the row unit  is lowered to the planting position, the opener discs  penetrate into the soil. At the same time, the soil forces the gauge wheels  to pivot upwardly until the gauge wheel arms  abut or come into contact with the stop position previously set with furrow depth adjusting member  or until a static load balance is achieved between the vertical load of the row unit and the reaction of the soil. As the planter is drawn forwardly in the direction indicated by arrow , the furrow opener discs cut a V-shaped furrow  into the soil while the gauge wheels  compact the soil to aid in formation of the V-shaped furrow. Individual seeds  from the seed hopper  are dispensed by the seed meter  into the seed tube  in uniformly spaced increments. The seed tube  directs the individual dispensed seeds  downwardly and rearwardly between the furrow opener discs  and into the bottom of the V-shaped furrow . The furrow  is then covered with soil and lightly compacted by the furrow closing assembly .illustrates a side view of another embodiment of a conventional row unit  for a central-fill planter such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,438,006, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. As in the row unit embodiment of , the row unit embodiment of  includes a parallel arm linkage  comprised of upper and lower parallel arms ,  pivotally mounted at a forward end to the transverse toolbar  and at their rearward end to the row unit frame . The row unit frame  supports a mini seed hopper , seed meter , a seed tube , as well as the furrow opener assembly , comprising a furrow opener discs  and gauge wheels . The gauge wheels  are pivotally secured to the row unit frame  by gauge wheel arms . Unlike the embodiment of , the gauge wheel arms  in the embodiment of  extend forwardly of the gauge wheels .The row units  in  are substantially the same as the row units  depicted in , respectively, except that in , the coil springs  have been removed and replaced with an embodiment of a dynamic supplemental downforce control system  in accordance with the present invention.schematically illustrates a preferred embodiment of the automated supplemental downforce control system  which comprises a closed-loop feedback circuit  that cooperates with a downforce actuator . Preferably, the dynamic system  utilizes the hydraulic system of the tractor pulling the planter and therefore preferably comprises an electro-hydraulic closed-loop feedback circuit  and a dual action hydraulic cylinder . However, the dynamic system  may be equally adapted for use with pneumatic actuators in cooperation with any corresponding electro-pneumatic closed-loop feedback circuit. It should also be appreciated that although the schematic illustration of  shows the dynamic system  in relation to a four-row planters, the dynamic system  can be adapted to a planter with any number of row units.As used herein, the term “actual gauge wheel downforce” Fa () refers to the dead load, live load and supplemental downforce transferred to the soil through the gauge wheels  of the row unit . The row unit dead load is understood to be the mass of the entire row unit and any accessories mounted thereon. Therefore, the row unit dead load remains substantially constant and would include the mass of the row unit frame , the furrow opening assembly , the furrow closing assembly , the hoppers , , seed meter , seed tube  and the mass of any other attachments or devices operably supported or carried by the row unit frame. The row unit live load is understood to be the mass of the seed, insecticide and/or fertilizer within the hoppers , ,  of the row unit or otherwise carried by the row unit. The live load typically varies as the material is dispensed during planting operations.The term “supplemental downforce,” as used herein refers to the loading, other than the live load and dead load, that is applied to the row unit to force the row unit downwardly or upwardly relative to the toolbar  to achieve the desired furrow depth and soil compaction under the gauge wheels . It should be understood that the supplemental downforce may increase or decrease the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa. It is recognized that a certain amount of the row unit dead load, live load and supplemental downforce is carried by the furrow opener discs  and the furrow closing assembly . Nevertheless, because the preferred system and method  disclosed herein preferably involves only the forces or loads exerted on or transferred by the gauge wheels, then loads transferred by the opener discs and closing wheel need not be considered.Referring to , it should be appreciated that if the downforce actuator  is extended, the row unit  will be forced downwardly relative to toolbar , resulting in an increase in the supplemental downforce and a corresponding increase in the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa. Likewise, if the downforce actuator  is retracted, the row unit  will be pulled upwardly relative to the toolbar , resulting in a decrease in the supplemental downforce and a corresponding reduction in the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa.Referring to , the preferred electro-hydraulic closed-loop feedback circuit  comprises a control module , a pilot pressure control valve , one load sensor  (preferably one per row unit), at least one direction control valve  (preferably one per row unit), fluid lines  and signal lines . As described in greater detail later, a lever  () is preferably disposed to transmit the up and down directional displacement of the gauge wheels and thus the corresponding actual gauge wheel downforce Fa, to the direction control valve . The signal lines  communicate electrical signals between the control module , the load sensor , the pilot pressure valve , and the direction control valve . The fluid lines communicate hydraulic fluid between a fluid source , the pilot pressure control valve , the direction control valve  and the downforce actuator . The fluid source  is preferably the hydraulic fluid reservoir of the tractor pulling the planter. It should be appreciated that if the dynamic system  is an electro-pneumatic system, the fluid source may be an air compressor, compressed air tank or other suitable air source.In general, through the control module , the operator is able to set the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd, which, in one embodiment, corresponds to the output pressure of the pilot pressure control valve . The control module  also preferably permits the operator to view the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa of the row units  as detected by the load sensors . The direction control valve  permits fluid flow to and from the individual downforce actuators  in response to any imbalance between the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd acting at one end of the direction control valves  against the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa acting at the other end of the direction control valves . Thus, the dynamic system  independently and dynamically adjusts the supplemental downforce for each individual row unit as each row unit experiences unique loading conditions during planting operations. The downforce adjustment occurs without the need for complex and expensive central processing circuitry or software programming that would otherwise be required to simultaneously monitor and compare the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd with the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa across all row units and to then send signals to independently control the downforce actuators  at each row unit.Although it is preferable for each row unit  to have separate load sensor  so the operator can monitor the actual gauge wheel downforce for each row, it may be desirable to have load sensors on only certain row units, such as on the outside row units and one or two inner row units. It should also be appreciated that although it is desirable for each row unit  to have a direction control valve , a single direction control valve  may be used to control fluid flow to the downforce actuators  of multiple row units. Similarly a single downforce actuator  may be utilized to control the supplemental downforce across multiple row units.The pilot pressure control valve  is in fluid communication with the fluid source  via fluid lines and the direction control valve  via fluid lines . It is also in electrical communication with the control module  via signal lines . The operator is able to set the desired output pressure of the pilot pressure control valve  via the control module . Suitable pilot pressure control valves include solenoid-operated proportional valves such as model no. PV72-21 distributed by HydraForce, Inc. in Lincolnshire, Ill.The load sensor  is disposed to preferably generate an electrical signal corresponding to the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa (). The control module  receives the generated signal from the load sensor  via the signal lines and preferably displays to the operator the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa corresponding to the generated signal. In a preferred embodiment, the load sensor  is a strain gauge such as a Wheatstone bridge circuit mounted in any suitable location from which the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa can be reasonably accurately determined. For example, the load sensor  may be mounted to detect the strain in the gauge wheel arm  () such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,389,999 to Duello, or U.S. Pat. No. 6,701,857 to Jensen, or the strain in the pivot pin of the depth adjusting member  (), such as disclosed in the Sauder '253 Application, or in the equalizer for the depth adjusting member as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/883,957 filed Jan. 8, 2008 by Sauder et al., or in a location such as disclosed in European Patent No. EP0372901 to Baker. All of the above-referenced patents and/or patent applications are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference.The control module  is preferably integrated into an existing planter monitor that provides a user interface, such as a touch screen, keypad or other input means, through which the operator can select or input the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd. The control module  is also preferably integrated into an existing planter monitor that provides a display screen or other visual display through which the operator can view and monitor the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa of the row units. In a preferred embodiment, the control module  is integrated into the 20/20® planter monitor system sold by Precision Planting, Inc., of Tremont, Ill. and as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/522,252 (Pub. No. US2010/0010667) by Sauder et al., incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Those skilled in the art would readily understand how to modify the 20/20® planter monitor or any other planter monitor to integrate the additional programming and circuitry necessary to allow an operator to input a desired gauge wheel downforce Fd for controlling the output of the pilot pressure valve  and to also receive and display the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa as detected by the load sensor . Alternatively, as would be recognized by those skilled in the art, the control module  may be a standalone system incorporating the necessary circuitry for controlling the output pressure of the pilot control valve  corresponding to the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd, and/or for displaying the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa of the row units. Regardless of whether the control module  is integrated into an existing planter monitor system or as a standalone unit, it is preferably mounted in the cab of the tractor in a location where an operator can view and interact with the user interface during planting operations.Referring to , the direction control valve  is preferably a three-position directional control valve similar such as model no. PTS16-12 distributed by Eaton Corporation, Eden Prairie, Minn. The direction control valve  preferably includes a housing  having an axial through-bore  and an enlarged counterbore . A series of ports extend transversely through the sidewall  of the housing  and into the axial through-bore , preferably including an inlet port , first and second fluid return ports , , and first and second actuator ports , . A spool  is slidably disposed within the housing . The spool  has a shaft  and an enlarged head . The enlarged head  is disposed within the counterbore . A spring  biases the spool head  leftward as viewed in . The shaft  includes two longitudinally spaced circumferential rings . The circumferential rings  define raised surfaces, which, when aligned with the first and second actuator ports ,  as shown in  effectively block the flow of fluid into or out of the ports and prevent passage of fluid from one side of the circumferential ring to the other. Thus, as illustrated in , the movement of the spool  within the through-bore  functions as a three position valve. The direction control valve  further includes a head cap  and an end cap . The head cap  includes an axial end port  in fluid communication with an axial counterbore . A block  is slidably disposed within the axial counterbore  and abuts the spring biased spool head . The end cap  has an axial bore  through which the distal end of the spool shaft  extends. O-rings  are provided to fluidly seal the head cap  and end cap  with the housing .In operation, referring to , fluid lines communicate fluid from the pilot pressure valve  to the axial end port  of the direction control valves  at a pressure corresponding to the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd. Another set of fluid lines communicate pressurized fluid from the fluid pressure source  to the inlet port  of each direction control valve . Another set of fluid lines communicate fluid between the fluid return ports ,  back to the fluid source . Another set of fluid lines communicate fluid between the first and second actuator ports ,  to each side of the piston  within the downforce actuator  of each row unit . The lever  () transmits the opposing actual gauge wheel downforce Fa to the distal end of the spool shaft  of the direction control valve .As depicted in , if the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd is the same as the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa transmitted by the lever  (i.e., Fd=Fa), the circumferential rings  on the spool shaft  are preferably aligned with the first and second actuator ports ,  thereby preventing fluid flow to and from the downforce actuator .As depicted in , if the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd is greater than the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa transmitted by the lever  (i.e., Fd>Fa), the spool shaft  will be forced to the right opening fluid communication between the fluid inlet port  and the second actuator port  and opening fluid communication between the first actuator port  and the first fluid return port  thereby allowing fluid to flow into the piston end of the downforce actuator  and out through the rod end of the downforce actuator  forcing the piston  downwardly thereby increasing the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa. When the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa is sufficiently increased to rebalance with the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd, the spool shaft  will return to the position as show in .As depicted in , if the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd is less than the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa transmitted by the lever  (i.e., Fd<Fa), the spool shaft  will be forced to the left opening fluid communication between the fluid inlet port  and the first actuator port  and opening fluid communication between the second actuator port  and the second fluid return port  thereby allowing fluid to flow into the rod end of the downforce actuator  and out through the piston end of the downforce actuator  forcing the piston  upwardly thereby decreasing the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa. When the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa is sufficiently decreased to rebalance with the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd, the spool shaft  will return to the position as shown in .It should be understood that instead of a system that utilizes a pilot pressure control valve  to transmit the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd to the direction control valve , any suitable electrical or electro-mechanical device may be used to transmit the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd to the direction control valve . For example, as illustrated in , a solenoid  may be employed to transmit the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd against spool head . In such an embodiment, the control module  would send an electrical signal to the solenoid  to cause the solenoid plunger  to be displaced corresponding to the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd which in turn acts upon the spool head  causing the corresponding displacement of the spool  to open and close the ports as described and illustrated in connection with .It should also be understood that the term “direction control valve”  should not be construed as being limited to the embodiment described and illustrated herein, but should instead be understood to include any device or combination of devices that allows fluid flow to and/or from the downforce actuator  when the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa becomes imbalanced with the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd.Because the gauge wheels  may occasionally encounter rocks or other obstructions during planting operations that may cause high impact forces, the direction control valve  is preferably mounted in a manner to avoid damage from the impact forces. For example, the direction control valve  is preferably bias mounted to allow the control valve  to displace longitudinally if an abrupt force imposed by the lever  on the spool  causes the spool head  to bottom out against the head cap . When the abrupt force is removed, the bias mount returns the direction control valve  to its normal position.In a preferred embodiment, the control module  cooperates with a Global Positioning System (GPS) and is configured to access a desired downforce prescription map for setting and/or modifying the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd as the planter traverses the field. The downforce prescription map may be based upon soil types, elevations, or location-specific preferences set by the operator prior to operation. In such an embodiment, the control module  may be used to specify a different desired gauge wheel downforce Fd to each row unit or groups of row units to more accurately follow the downforce prescription map. For example, if the locations of the far right row unit and the far left row unit on the planter correspond to different prescribed desired gauge wheel downforces Fd based on soil type or other predefined factor, the control module  is preferably capable of setting the appropriate desired gauge wheel downforce Fd for each of the row units.In addition, the control module  is preferably configured to determine and display a ground contact percentage as disclosed in applicant's co-pending international patent application no. PCT/US2008/050427 (Pub. No. WO2009/042238), which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The control module  is preferably configured to allow the operator to select a desired minimum ground contact percentage in addition to, or rather than, inputting a specific desired gauge wheel downforce Fd. In such an embodiment, the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd would be the desired minimum ground contact percentage. The dynamic system  would adjust the supplemental downforce until the actual gauge wheel downforce Fa in relation to the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd resulted in the desired minimum ground contact percentage over the sampling period. Thus, as used herein, the term “desired gauge wheel downforce Fd” should be understood to include a force that may be expressed as a numerical value or as a percentage of ground contact.The closed-loop feedback circuit  preferably cooperates with a transport position detector  (), such as a height sensor or contact switch disposed on the frame of the planter, to detect when the planter is raised into a transport position. It should be appreciated that when the planter is raised, the gauge wheel arms  will pivot downwardly resulting in the load sensor  to sense zero or near zero actual gauge wheel downforce Fa, which in turn will result in fluid flow to the downforce actuator  until it is fully extended. To prevent such a result from occurring, the transport position detector  is preferably in electrical communication with a valve  disposed along the fluid supply line . When the detector  detects that the planter is in a transport position, the valve  is closed to prevent the flow of fluid from the fluid source  to the fluid inlet ports  of the direction control valves  of the row units . The valve  is preferably a two-position normally open solenoid valve.Alternatively, instead of a separate valve  disposed in the fluid supply line , the transport position detector  may be in electrical communication with the pilot pressure control valve  such that when the planter is raised into the transport position, the transport position detector  sends a signal to cause the pilot pressure control valve  to close. In such an event the downforce actuators  will automatically “raise” in an effort to rebalance the load between Fd and Fa, by allowing fluid to flow through the direction control valve  as indicated in , because Fd will be zero when the pilot pressure control valve  is closed. When the load sensor  senses zero when the gauge wheels are raised above the soil such that Fd=Fa, the direction control valve  will return to the position illustrated in  preventing fluid flow to the downforce actuator .Furthermore, it should be understood that the pilot pressure control valve  and the control module  may be combined into a single manually operated pressure regulating valve. In such an embodiment, the manually operated pressure regulating valve would preferably include labels or markers relating each pressure setting to the gauge wheel reaction force. In the same embodiment, the output pilot pressures corresponding to the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd would also be set manually. Such an embodiment is shown in , which illustrates a portion of the closed-loop feedback circuit  wherein control module  and the pilot pressure valve  are replaced by a manually operated pressure regulating valve . The valve  includes a controller  such as a dial or knob, and settings  corresponding to the desired gauge wheel downforce Fd, which may be indicated in pounds force as illustrated or in any other desired units.In another embodiment, the load sensor  may include a piezoelectric load cell such as a compression load cell model no. FSH00402 available from Futek in Irvine, Calif., which may be disposed between the direction control valve  and the lever . Such an embodiment is illustrated in , in which a load cell  is mounted to the distal end of the spool shaft  of the direction control valve .The foregoing description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment of the apparatus, and the general principles and features of the system and methods described herein will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art. Thus, the present invention is not to be limited to the embodiments of the apparatus, system and methods described above and illustrated in the drawing figures, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the spirit and scope of the appended claims."

                "1. Field of InventionThis invention relates to a pivotable harvesting header for a combine harvester, and more particularly, to a pivotable header with a hydraulic accumulator that can be adjusted for differing field conditions.2. Description of Related ArtAgricultural harvesters such as combines are typically equipped with a harvesting header. For example, corn headers are specifically designed to pick corn and vary in size from two-row units to twelve-row units or more. As the harvester moves through the field, each row-unit passes between rows of corn. Corn header row units typically use gathering chains to covey crop material and ears rearward toward a cross auger. A set of driven snap rolls, which rotate based on the speed of the harvester, grabs the corn stalks and forces them downward between stripper plates. The ears of corn are snapped free of the stalk and the cross auger passes the ears to the feeder housing of the harvester.The height of the harvesting header typically may be adjusted by pivoting or rotating the feederhouse upwardly and downwardly about a rotational axis adjacent a rearward end thereof. However, corn headers are typically fixed on the feederhouse at a selected fore and aft angle. It would also be desirable to adjust the fore/aft pitch of the header on the feederhouse to optimize crop cutting and feeding into the combine.In one embodiment, the invention is directed a harvesting header and feederhouse for use with a crop harvesting machine. The harvesting header has a feederhouse interface at the end of the feederhouse and a header frame providing structural support for the harvesting header. The header frame has a top beam, a bottom beam, and first and second vertical main structures connecting the top and bottom beams. A pivotable connection between the feederhouse interface and the vertical main structures of the header frame enable the header frame to pivot with respect to the feederhouse interface. At least one hydraulic ram connects between the feederhouse interface and the header frame to pivot the harvesting header on the feederhouse and a hydraulic supply provides pressurized hydraulic fluid to the at least one hydraulic ram. The hydraulic system also has an accumulator assembly fluidically connected between the hydraulic supply and the at least one hydraulic ram. The accumulator assembly has a precharge fluid/gas interface between a gas chamber and the hydraulic supply, and a working fluid/gas interface between the gas chamber and the at least one hydraulic ram.These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in, or are apparent from, the following detailed description of various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention.Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the views of the drawings.The present invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms. While the drawings illustrate and the specification describes certain preferred embodiments of the invention, it is to be understood that such disclosure is by way of example only. There is no intent to limit the principles of the present invention to the particular disclosed embodiments. References hereinafter made to certain directions, such as, for example, “front”, “rear”, “left” and “right”, are made as viewed from the side of the combine.Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to , a harvesting header for use with an agricultural combine harvester (not shown) is seen generally at . As is known in the art, the harvesting header  is mounted in a cantilevered manner on a feederhouse  () of the combine harvester at a center area  of the harvesting header . The illustrated harvesting header  shown herein is a corn header designed to harvest multiple rows of corn simultaneously. However, one skilled in the art will understand that harvesting headers  for use in harvesting other crops may utilize concepts described herein without departing from the scope of the invention. As is known in the art, the height of the harvesting header  may be adjusted by pivoting or rotating the feederhouse  upwardly and downwardly about a rotational axis adjacent a rearward end thereof. Accordingly, the front end of the feederhouse  moves along an arc as the feederhouse  is rotated about the rearward axis. The feederhouse  is supportable in any suitable manner known in the art, such as using one or more fluid cylinders (not shown) extendable and retractable for pivotally rotating feederhouse  about its axis for raising and lowering the harvesting header .Row units  that may be of conventional construction are arranged in side-by-side relationship on the harvesting header . Although sixteen row units  are shown here, the harvesting header  may have any number of such units, in side-by-side relationship, across its width. Each row unit  is desirably constructed and operated in a substantially identical manner through any known means. The row units  may have a removable snout or divider  hingedly coupled to the front of each of the row units . As is known in the art, corn stalks are drawn into slots  formed by the row units , such as with gathering chains (not shown). Snapping rolls (not shown) pull the corn stalks downwardly through the slot  and the ears of corn are stripped off of the stalks as the stalks are pulled downwardly between them. Ears of corn are stripped from each of the stalks and carried by an auger  in a trough  toward the feederhouse . The collected ears are then carried rearwardly and upwardly into a threshing assembly (not shown) of the combine harvester as known in the art.Turning also now to , the row units  are mounted on a tool bar  that extends transversely across the width of the header . The gathering chains and snapping rolls are driven by a rotating row unit shaft  which extends transversely of the units over the width of the harvesting header . The row unit shaft  is drivingly connected to each row unit  through any known gear box assembly (not shown). The row unit shaft  is driven by a power take-off (PTO) shaft  through a header drive system . In one embodiment, the header drive system  includes a pair of substantially identical drive assemblies . Each drive assembly  includes a cog belt (not shown) housed in a belt case  to transfer power from PTO shafts  extending from opposing sides of the feederhouse  to the row unit shaft . However, one skilled in the art will understand that the header drive system  may utilize any other chain or gearbox assembly without departing from the scope of the invention.In the illustrated embodiment, the harvesting header  has a header frame  with a top beam  which extends across an upper-rear portion of the harvesting header . The top beam  has ends  and  arranged at opposite ends of the harvesting header  such that the top beam  extends substantially the full width of the harvesting header . The top beam  provides the main structural support for the header frame  and desirably is a round tube that provides suitable resistance to torque. The header frame  further includes end panels  attached to the ends  and  of the top beam . Desirably, the top beam  is welded to gussets  on the end panels  using sound engineering judgment. The end panels  provide support for the tool bar  which extends parallel to and spaced forwardly of the top beam . End panels  also provide rotational support for the row unit shaft  with bearings .The header frame  also has a bottom beam  extending across a portion of the width of the header that is generally parallel to and below the top beam . Desirably, the bottom beam  also is a round tube that provides suitable resistance to torque. The bottom beam  has a midpoint generally in the center area  of the harvesting header . Desirably, the bottom beam  does not extend the full width of the harvesting header  and the top beam  and bottom beam  are continuous through the center area . However, one skilled in the art will understand that other structure for the header frame  may be used using sound engineering judgment without departing from the scope of the invention.The header frame also has a pair of vertical main structures  that in the illustrated embodiment connect the top beam  and the bottom beam  and form the center area  where the feederhouse  connects to the harvesting header . The vertical main structures  pivotably connect the harvesting header  with the feederhouse . Desirably, the top beam  and bottom beam  are continuous through the center area  of the harvesting header . By continuous through the center area , it is meant that the top beam  and the bottom beam  are continuous members that extend through the center area  and out at least partially towards the end panels  of the header frame .Desirably, one vertical main structure  is attached to the bottom beam  a distance away from the midpoint of the bottom beam  toward a first end  of the bottom beam , and the second vertical main structure  is attached to the bottom beam  a substantially equal distance from the midpoint but toward an opposing end  of the bottom beam . Desirably, the bottom beam  has a width that is between about  percent to about  percent of the width of the harvesting header . In one embodiment, ends ,  of the bottom beam  extend past the vertical main structures  and header drive assemblies  are arranged at opposite ends  of the bottom beam . Likewise, the first vertical main structure  is attached to the top beam  a distance away from the midpoint of the top beam  toward the end  of the top beam , and the second vertical main structure  is attached to the top beam  the same distance from the midpoint of the top beam  but toward the opposing end  of the top beam . Suitable gusset plates  are used in welding the vertical main structures  to the top beam  and bottom beam . Connecting plates  extend from the vertical main structures  and support the tool bar .Diagonal truss members  connect the top beam  and the bottom beam . In the illustrated embodiment, diagonal truss members  connect the outer ends .  of the top beam  with the bottom beam . In one embodiment, outer ends of the diagonal truss members  are structurally connected to respective ends of the top beam , and inner ends of the diagonal truss members  are structurally connected adjacent respective interfaces of the bottom beam  and the vertical main structures . By “structurally connected”, it is meant that the diagonal truss members  are joined either directly or indirectly with suitable gusset plates using sound engineering judgment. Desirably, the components are welded together using suitable gusset plates. The header frame  further comprises two inner support plates , each of which is attached to a diagonal truss member  so as to be supported thereby. Each of the inner support plates  supports the tool bar .According to the invention, the header frame  of the harvesting header  is pivotably connected to a feederhouse interface  located at a front end of the feederhouse .  show the header frame  mounted to the feederhouse interface  with the remainder of the feederhouse  removed for clarity. In one embodiment, the feederhouse interface  has an interface plate  with mounting flanges  at its outer sides. The interface plate  can be mounted to the forward portion of the feederhouse  using any known means using sound engineering judgment. Desirably, the mounting flanges  extend rearwardly from the interface plate  and are positioned such that they fit inside and adjacent the vertical main structures  of the header frame . In the illustrated embodiment, each vertical main structure  attaches its adjacent mounting flange  with a pivotable connection . In the illustrated embodiment, the pivotable connection  includes a pivot pin  disposed in a first cylindrical bore  passing through the mounting flange  and a second cylindrical bore  passing through the vertical main section . Desirably, suitable bushings  are received in the first and second bores , . In the illustrated embodiment, brackets  fixedly disposed on the vertical main sections  are used to fix outer ends of the pivot pins  to the vertical main sections , while the pivot pins  are free to rotate with respect to the mounting flanges  so that pivotable movement of the header frame  on the feederhouse interface  may be obtained. Alternately, the pivot pins  may be fixedly disposed with respect to the mounting flanges  while being free to rotate with respect to the vertical main sections . Additionally, one skilled in the art will understand that the header frame  may be pivotably coupled to the feederhouse interface  in other manners using sound engineering judgment.Turning now to , at least one hydraulic working ram  connects between the feederhouse interface  and the header frame  to control pivoting motion of the harvesting header  on the feederhouse . In the illustrated embodiment, two hydraulic rams  connect between the header frame  and the feederhouse interface . In the illustrated embodiment, one end  of the hydraulic ram  is connected to a feederhouse bracket  mounted on a lower section  of the interface plate  and the opposing end  of the hydraulic ram  is attached to a header bracket  mounted on the toolbar . However, one skilled in the art will understand that the hydraulic rams  may connect between other portions of the feederhouse interface  and other portions of the header frame  to cause pivoting motion about the pivotable connection  without departing from the scope of the invention. Desirably, the hydraulic rams  are hydraulically operated one-way rams in which the extension of the ram is controlled by the pressure of the hydraulic fluid ported to the body of the ram . The hydraulic rams may be of conventional design well understood by those skilled in the art and need not be described in greater detail herein.illustrates of a hydraulic circuit  associated with the hydraulic rams . The hydraulic circuit  includes a hydraulic supply  that may include one or more hydraulic pumps used to control the pressure of hydraulic fluid in the circuit  and hydraulic supply line  that ports the hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic rams . As hydraulic pressure is increased, the ram  extends and the harvesting header  pivots relative the feederhouse interface  about the pivotable connections . The operator may change the angle of the harvesting header  with respect to the feederhouse  and the ground by controlling the hydraulic supply . Desirably, the hydraulic supply  may be selectively controlled from the cab of the combine during operations to change the angle of the header  based on the conditions encountered by the combine.The hydraulic circuit  also includes a variable precharge accumulator assembly  connected between the hydraulic supply  and the hydraulic rams . As the harvesting header  operates close to the ground, the harvesting header  may strike uneven terrain that would cause the header frame  to bounce against the force of the hydraulic rams . The accumulator assembly  cushions the load on the hydraulic rams  and lessens the shock and stresses caused by such impact by introducing a pressurized gas, preferably nitrogen, into the hydraulic circuit . Desirably, the accumulator assembly  uses a compressed gas, however spring or other energy storing means may be used without departing from the scope of the invention.According to the invention, the accumulator assembly  has a precharge fluid/gas interface  between a gas chamber  and the hydraulic supply , and a working fluid/gas interface  between the gas chamber  and the working ram . Controlling the precharge enables the operator of the combine to adjust the pressure in the accumulator assembly  based on desired stiffness of the header  and differing field conditions. In the illustrated embodiment, the precharge fluid/gas interface  is formed by a precharge adjusting accumulator  and the working fluid/gas interface  is formed by a working accumulator . The precharge adjusting and working accumulators ,  may use a piston, bladder, or diaphragm to separate the gas from the hydraulic fluid. Gas sides ,  of the precharge adjusting accumulator  and the working accumulator  are connected by bloc  so that gas pressure is substantially the same in the two accumulators , . Optionally, bloc  contains a precharge isolation valve  enabling the precharge adjusting accumulator  to be isolate from the working accumulator  once desired gas pressure is obtained. The bloc  desirably also contains a gas supply inlet  with a gas supply isolation valve  and a port  for a pressure transducer  capable of reading gas pressure in the accumulator assembly  and providing this information to the operator of the combine. While the illustrated embodiment comprises the precharge adjusting accumulator  and the working accumulator  connected by bloc , one skilled in the art will understand that the precharge and working fluid/gas interfaces ,  may be formed by an accumulator having three chambers, with fluid chambers on each side with a gas chamber in the center, without departing from the scope of the invention. In this embodiment, one of the fluid chambers would be on the working side and the other fluid chamber would control the precharge.A hydraulic supply valve  ports hydraulic fluid to the working rams  and selectively to a fluid-side  of the precharge fluid/gas interface . Positioning the hydraulic supply valve  to connect the hydraulic supply  to the fluid-side  of the precharge fluid/gas interface  enables the operator to adjust the precharge of the accumulator assembly  by adjusting the fluid pressure against the precharge fluid/gas interface . This enables the operator to select the gas pressure against the working fluid/gas interface  of the accumulator assembly . Desirably, the hydraulic supply valve  may be selectively controlled from the cab of the combine to change the gas pressure in the accumulator assembly  during operations based on the conditions encountered by the combine. Optionally, an accumulator isolation valve  is located so at to provide the option of isolating the accumulator assembly  from the remaining portions of the hydraulic circuit  if operations without an accumulator are desired.Returning to , the harvesting header also includes a front ground sensor  near a leading tip of at least one of the snouts  and a rear ground sensor  located near the rear of the header . Multiple front and rear ground sensors ,  may be used along the length of the header . Conventional ground sensors known to those skilled in the art may be used for the front and rear ground sensors , , and additional detail for such sensors need not be included herein. A header control system  shown schematically in  receives a signal from the front ground sensor  and the rear ground sensor  and provides feedback to control the fore/aft pitch angle of the header . The header control system  is operable to sense movement of the header  as the header  moves over uneven terrain and provides an output signal to the hydraulic supply . As described above, the hydraulic supply  controls the positions of the hydraulic rams  and thus the fore/aft pitch angle of the harvesting header  relative feederhouse interface  and the ground for optimal cutting performance.The foregoing has broadly outlined some of the more pertinent aspects and features of the present invention. These should be construed to be merely illustrative of some of the more prominent features and applications of the invention. Other beneficial results can be obtained by applying the disclosed information in a different manner or by modifying the disclosed embodiments. Accordingly, other aspects and a more comprehensive understanding of the invention may be obtained by referring to the detailed description of the exemplary embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in addition to the scope of the invention defined by the claims."

                "Embodiments of the present invention are direct generally to a lockout clutch. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to a lockout clutch for use on an agricultural seed planting machine.Currently-used agricultural seeding machines implement various types of transmission systems operable to transmit power and/or rotation to components of the machines so as to facilitate the dispensing of seed from the machines. In particular, the machines will often include chain-driven transmission systems that are operable to drive seed dispensing mechanisms associated with the machines. Such transmission systems are often powered by rotating components of the machines, such as the machines' wheels, rollers, or the like. During use of the seeding machines, the rotating components generally rotate in response to the movement of the machines. For example, if a seeding machine travels in a first direction, the rotating components will similarly rotate in a first direction. Alternatively, if the seeding machine travels in a second direction, the rotating components will similarly rotate in a second direction. Because the seed dispensing mechanisms of the seeding machines are directly linked to the rotating components via the transmission systems, the seed dispensing mechanisms will be driven regardless of the direction in which the seeding machines are moving.However, many seed dispensing mechanisms can be damaged if they are driven in a particular direction. For example, fluted meter-type seed dispensing mechanisms are generally only operable to rotate in a certain first direction and become inoperable and/or damaged if caused to rotate in a second direction. As such, because the seed dispensing mechanisms are driven by the transmission systems of the seeding machines, the seed dispensing mechanisms can be damaged when the seeding machines are travelling in a particular direction (e.g., reverse). Furthermore, it is often desired or necessary to move the seeding machines in multiple directions without the seed dispensing mechanisms of the seeding machines dispensing seed at all. For example, it may be necessary to use the seeding machines to till or otherwise condition the soil before dispensing seed into the soil. As such, it may be necessary to cause the seeding machines to move in all directions for a time without dispensing seed.In the past, it was only possible to disengage the seed dispensing mechanism of a seeding machine by having a user physically remove a pin from a sprocket assembly within the transmission system of the seeding machine. Upon removing the pin, the seed dispensing mechanism could not be driven in either direction. Once the user no longer required the seed dispensing mechanism to be disengaged, the user was required to re-align and re-insert the pin. Such actions were difficult, time-consuming, and often times dangerous.In one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a seed planting machine comprising: a seed bin; a rotatable seed dispensing mechanism for dispensing seed from the seed bin; a ground-engaging roller mechanism; and a chain drive transmission system for selectively transmitting rotation from the ground-engaging roller mechanism to the seed dispensing mechanism. The seed planting machine provides for the transmission to include a lockout clutch with an actuator for shifting the lockout clutch between a first configuration and a second configuration. As such, the lockout clutch, in the first configuration, is operable to drive the seed dispensing mechanism in response to the roller mechanism rotating in a first direction, and is not operable to drive the seed dispensing mechanism in response to the roller mechanism rotating in a second direction. Furthermore, the lockout clutch, in the second configuration, is not operable to drive the seed dispensing mechanism in response to the roller mechanism rotating in the first direction, and is not operable to drive the seed dispensing mechanism in response to the roller mechanism rotating in the second direction.In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for planting seeds with a planter, with the planter having a lockout clutch with an actuator for shifting the planter between a first configuration and a second configuration. The method includes the first step of engaging the actuator of the lockout clutch to configure the planter in the first configuration. The next step includes travelling in a first direction using the planter configured in the first configuration, such that the lockout clutch transmits rotational motion and the planter dispenses seeds. The next step includes travelling in a second direction using the planter configured in the first configuration, such that the lockout clutch does not transmit rotational motion and the planter does not dispense seeds. In a next step, the actuator of the lockout clutch is disengaged to configure the planter in the second configuration. Thereafter, the next step includes travelling in the first direction using the planter configured in the second configuration, such that the lockout clutch does not transmit rotational motion and the planter does not dispense seeds. Finally, the last step includes travelling in the second direction using the planter configured in the second configuration, such that the lockout clutch does not transmit rotational motion and the planter does not dispense seeds.In yet another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a lockout clutch assembly comprising: an axle; a drive sprocket rotatably mounted on the axle; a driven sprocket rotatably mounted on the axle; and an actuator for shifting the lockout clutch assembly between a first configuration and a second configuration. As such, and with the lockout clutch assembly in the first configuration, a rotation of the drive sprocket in a first direction is operable to cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket in the first direction. Contrastingly, a rotation of the drive sprocket in a second direction is not operable to cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket in the second direction. With the lockout clutch assembly in the second configuration, a rotation of the drive sprocket in the first direction is not operable to cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket in the first direction. Similarly, a rotation of the drive sprocket in the second direction is not operable to cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket in the second direction.This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the embodiments and the accompanying drawing figures.The drawing figures do not limit the present invention to the specific embodiments disclosed and described herein. The drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon clearly illustrating the principles of the invention.The following detailed description of the present invention references various embodiments. The embodiments are intended to describe aspects of the invention in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments can be utilized and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense. The scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.depict a lockout clutch assembly  according to embodiments of the present invention. The lockout clutch assembly  includes an axle , a drive sprocket  rotatably mounted on the axle, a driven sprocket  rotatably mounted on the axle, and an actuator  received within the driven sprocket. The actuator is operable to shift the lockout clutch assembly between a first configuration and a second configuration. In certain embodiments, the lockout clutch assembly will further include a catch plate  rotatably mounted on the axle  between the drive sprocket  and the driven sprocket . In such embodiments, each of the drive sprocket , driven sprocket , and catch plate  are generally capable of independent rotation about the axle . The lockout clutch assembly  may be formed from various types of high-strength material, such as iron, steel, carbon fiber, high-strength polymers, or the like, and/or combinations thereof.With reference to , the catch plate  includes an interior side  and an exterior side , with the interior side  facing the drive sprocket  and the exterior side  facing the driven sprocket . As shown on , the interior side  of the catch plate  includes a circular ring projection  that extends around a circumference of the interior side. Embodiments of the present invention may provide for the circular ring projection  to be integral with the catch plate , such that  is illustrative of an exploded view of the catch plate  with the circular ring projection  separated from remaining portions of the catch plate . With reference to , the circular ring projection  includes a radially inwardly facing surface having a plurality of ratchet teeth  formed thereon.With reference to , the drive sprocket  includes a central projection  having a plurality of pawls  rotatable mounted therein. The pawls  are securely mounted on the drive sprocket , such that a rotation of the drive sprocket  will cause a corresponding rotation of the pawls . The central projection  additionally includes a plurality of springs  extending radially outward from the central projection  and engaging the pawls . As such, the springs  are operable to bias an end of the pawls  in a position rotated away from the central projection . The pawls  are, therefore, biased such that the ends of the pawls  are operable to be generally engaged with the ratchet teeth  of said catch plate , as will be discussed below with reference to .For example, when the drive sprocket  is rotated in a first direction, such as clockwise as shown in , the pawls  will similarly rotate clockwise. With the pawls  engaged with the teeth  of the catch plate , the pawls  are operable to drive the catch plate  in the clockwise direction. Contrastingly, when the drive sprocket  is rotated in a second direction, such as counterclockwise in , the pawls  will similarly rotate counterclockwise. However, the pawls  do not engage with the teeth  of the catch plate  when rotated in the counterclockwise direction. Instead, the pawls  will freely rotate about the interior of the circular ring projection  of the catch plate . The pawls  will continually pass by each of the teeth , without engagement with the teeth , when rotating in the counterclockwise direction. As such, the catch plate  will not be caused to rotate by the drive sprocket  and its pawls .Returning to , the actuator  generally comprises a longitudinal shaft having first and second ends. The first end of the actuator  may include a handle portion  with a diameter generally greater than a diameter of a main central portion of the actuator . The second end of the actuator  may include a projection  with a diameter generally less than a diameter of the main central portion. The actuator  is coupled within the driven sprocket  via an opening  extending through the driven sprocket . The opening  is sized such that the actuator  is capable of translating through the opening . In some embodiments, the actuator  may include a restricting mechanism , such as a restricting nut, that prevents the actuator  from being completely removed from the opening  of the driven sprocket .Remaining with , the catch plate  includes a plurality of openings  circumferentially-positioned on its exterior side  and extending through to its interior side . In some embodiments, the openings  extend through an entire thickness of the catch plate , including the circular ring projection . However, in other embodiments, the openings  may only extend from the exterior side  of the catch plate  through a portion of the thickness of the catch plate. Nevertheless, the openings  are sized so as to be operable to receive at least a portion of the actuator . For instance, in some embodiments, each of the openings  is capable of receiving the projection  of the actuator , such that the actuator  is operable to engage with the catch plate .The axle  may comprise a central pin  surrounded by a bushing sleeve . In some embodiments, the drive sprocket , the driven sprocket , and the catch plate  may be rotatably secured around an exterior of the bushing sleeve . In some embodiments, bushing sleeve  may include one or more grease channels  formed on its outer surface. Furthermore, the axle  may be associated with one or more grease fittings  positioned around the bushing sleeve  in fluid communication with the grease channels . As such, grease may be introduced to the axle  via the grease fittings  and into the grease channels . The grease in the grease channels  is operable to reduce rotational friction between the axle  and the drive sprocket , the driven sprocket , and the catch plate . In some additional embodiments, the axle  may also be associated with one or more washer elements  for enhancing load distribution and for securing the drive sprocket , the driven sprocket , and the catch plate  about the axle .In operation, the lockout clutch assembly  is operable to be configured in at least two configurations. Specifically, with the actuator  engaged with the catch plate , the lockout clutch assembly  is in the first configuration. As such, and with reference to , when the drive sprocket  is rotated in the first direction (e.g., clockwise in ), the catch plate  will similarly rotate in the first direction due to the engagement of the pawls  with the teeth , as previously described. Furthermore, with the actuator  engaged with the catch plate , the catch plate  is operable to drive the actuator . Because the actuator  is connected to the driven sprocket , via the opening , the driven sprocket  will similarly be driven to rotate in the first direction (e.g., clockwise in ). Contrastingly, with reference to , when the drive sprocket  is rotated in a second direction (e.g., counterclockwise in ), the pawls  will not engage with the teeth  of the catch plate , such that the catch plate  will not be caused to rotate, as was previously described. As such, even with the actuator  engaged with the catch plate , the driven sprocket  will not be caused to rotate in response to the drive sprocket  rotating in the second direction. With the actuator  not engaged with the catch plate , the lockout clutch assembly  is in the second configuration. In such a configuration, and as illustrated in  as previously described, when the drive sprocket  is rotated in either the first direction (e.g., clockwise in ) or the second direction (e.g., counterclockwise in ), the driven sprocket  will not be caused to rotate.In certain alternative embodiments of the lockout clutch , the catch plate  may not be positioned between the drive sprocket  and the driven sprocket . In such embodiments, the catch plate  may be positioned on either side of the drive sprocket  or of the driven sprocket . In such instances, either the drive sprocket  or the driven sprocket  will be positioned between the catch plate  and the other of the drive sprocket  or the driven sprocket . Nevertheless, even in such configurations, the lock out clutch is operable to be selectively configured in either the first or second configurations, as previously described.Embodiments of the present invention provide for the lockout clutch assembly , as described above, to be incorporated in a seed planting machine, such that the seed planting machine is operable to selectively dispense seeds based on a direction of travel of the machine. In more detail and with reference to , embodiments of the present invention include a seed planting machine  broadly comprising a seed bin  for housing seed, a rotatable seed dispensing mechanism  for dispensing seed from said seed bin, a ground-engaging roller mechanism , and a chain drive transmission system  for selectively transmitting rotation from said ground-engaging roller mechanism to said seed dispensing mechanism. In certain embodiments, the transmission system  will include the lockout clutch assembly . As described above, the lockout clutch assembly  is operable to shift between the first configuration and the second configuration, and as such, is operable to configure the seed planting machine  in either a first configuration or a second configuration. Furthermore, the transmission system  may include a plurality of sprockets, pulleys, gears, or other rotational mechanisms linked by chains, belts, or the like. As such, the transmission system  is capable of transmitting rotation from the ground-engaging mechanism  to a plurality of mechanisms on the seed planting machine .In certain embodiments, the seed planting machine  will include only a single seed bin  for housing seed. As illustrated by , the seed bin  may include a mixing mechanism  comprising a paddle wheel, an auger agitator, mixing arms, or any otherwise generally elongated shaft having a plurality of mixing elements (e.g., agitators, paddles, or the like) extending radially therefrom. In operation, the mixing mechanism  is operable to be rotated within the seed bin , such that the mixing mechanism  continually mixes the seed within the seed bin, thereby keeping the seed from clumping together (i.e., coagulating), keeping the seed from bridging within the seed bin , and generally keeping a consistent flow of seed to the seed dispensing mechanism . In some embodiments, the mixing mechanism  will include a drive component , such as a sprocket, pulley, or a gear, which is operable to drive the mixing mechanism  and which is integrally connected with an end of the mixing mechanism . The drive component  is integrally connected to the mixing mechanism , such that a rotation of the drive component  causes a corresponding rotation of the mixing mechanism .The seed dispensing mechanism  will generally be positioned adjacent to a lower portion and/or below the seed bin  and will extend across a length of the seed bin. In some embodiments, as illustrated in , the seed dispensing mechanism  will comprise a fluted roller and/or a metering sprocket  housed within a seed cup . In further embodiments, the seed dispensing mechanism  may alternatively comprise metering belts, metering discs, metering augers, or the like. Regardless, in some embodiments, the seed dispensing mechanism  will include a plurality of interconnected fluted rollers/metering sprockets , each being housed within a seed cup . As such, the seed contained within the seed bin  is operable to be gravity fed into the seed cups  and precisely dispensed to the ground via the fluted rollers/metering sprockets . In such embodiments, the fluted rollers/metering sprockets  are interconnected via a shaft, such that the fluted rollers/metering sprockets  will each rotate at a common speed. As the fluted rollers/metering sprockets  rotate, they are operable to dispense seed from the seed bin  to the ground. In some embodiments, the seed dispensing mechanism  will be rotated via a drive component , such as a sprocket, pulley, or a gear, which is integrally connected with an end of the seed dispensing mechanism . In other embodiments, the seed dispensing mechanism  will be rotated via a drive component  (See ) positioned at a location along a length of the seed dispensing mechanism . Regardless, the drive component ( or ) is integrally connected to the seed dispensing mechanism , such that a rotation of the drive component ( or ) causes a corresponding rotation of the seed dispensing mechanism .Embodiments of the present invention provide for the ground-engaging roller mechanism  to comprise various types of rolling mechanisms. For example, the ground-engaging mechanism  may include an extended spiked roller, a packer roller, an aerator, disc harrows, or the like. In other embodiments, the ground-engaging mechanism  may simply include one or more of the wheels of the seed planting machine . In some embodiments, such as illustrated in , the ground-engaging mechanism  will be positioned at a rear of the seed planting machine . In other embodiments, the ground-engaging mechanism  may be positioned at front, or at a position between the front and rear, of the seed planting machine . Nevertheless, the ground-engaging mechanism  will include a driven component , such as a sprocket, pulley, or a gear, which is integrally connected with an end of the ground-engaging mechanism . The driven component  is integrally connected, such that a rotation of the ground-engaging mechanism  causes a corresponding rotation of the driven component .As such, the ground-engaging mechanism  is configured to rotate when the seed planting machine  is in motion. For example, and with reference to  in which the ground-engaging mechanism  is positioned adjacent to the rear of the seed planting machine , when the seed planting machine  is moving forward (as indicated by Arrow ), the ground-engaging mechanism  will correspondingly rotate in a first direction (i.e., clockwise when viewing a right side of the seed planting machine , as in ). Alternatively, when the seed planting machine  is moving in a reverse direction (as indicated by Arrow ), the ground-engaging mechanism  will correspondingly rotate in a second direction (i.e., counterclockwise when viewing the right side of the seed planting machine , as in ). Furthermore, because the driven component  correspondingly rotates with the ground-engaging mechanism , the driven component  will similarly rotate in the first direction (i.e., clockwise) when the seed planting machine  is moving in the forward direction and will rotate in the second direction (i.e., counterclockwise) when the seed planting machine  is moving in the reverse direction.The chain drive transmission system  is operable to selectively transmit rotation from the ground-engaging mechanism  to the seed dispensing mechanism . In some embodiments, the transmission system  will include the lockout clutch , one or more sprockets/sprocket assemblies, and one or more chains operable to interconnect the one or more sprocket/sprocket assemblies, the lockout clutch , and the drive/driven components of the seed planting machine  (e.g., drive/driven components , , ). As such, the chains are operable to transmit rotation between the lockout clutch  and the one or more sprockets/sprocket assemblies of the transmission system , and to/from the drive/driven components of the mixing mechanism , the seed dispensing mechanism , and the ground-engaging mechanism  of the seed planting machine  (e.g., via drive/driven components , , ).For example, and with reference to , the driven component  of the ground-engaging mechanism  may be linked with the lockout clutch  via a first chain. In particular, the first chain may be engaged with the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch . Furthermore, the drive component ( or ) of the seed dispensing mechanism  may be linked with the lockout clutch  directly or indirectly via a one or more additional chains and sprockets/sprocket assemblies of the transmission system . For example, a second chain may be engaged with the driven sprocket  of the lockout clutch  may be directly connected with the drive component ( or ) of the seed dispensing mechanism  via a second chain. However, it is understood that in certain embodiments, such as shown in , the drive component ( or ) of the seed dispensing mechanism  and the lockout clutch  may not be directly linked via the second chain, but instead, may be indirectly linked via one or more sprockets/sprocket assemblies and/or chains of the transmission system .Nevertheless, and regardless of whether the seed dispensing mechanism  is directly or indirectly connected with the lockout clutch , a rotation of the ground-engaging mechanism  will cause a corresponding rotation of the driven component , which will cause the first chain to translate, thereby causing a corresponding rotation of the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch . Thus, a rotation of the ground-engaging mechanism  in a first direction will cause a corresponding rotation of the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch  in the first direction, and a rotation of the ground-engaging mechanism  in a second direction will cause a corresponding rotation of the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch  in the second direction. As previously described, with the lockout clutch in the first configuration (i.e., with the actuator  engaged with the catch plate ), a rotation of the drive sprocket  in the first direction will cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket  in the first direction. Contrastingly, a rotation of the drive sprocket  in the second direction will not cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket  in the second direction. Because the driven sprocket  is linked with the drive component ( or ) of the seed dispensing mechanism , either directly or indirectly, a rotation of the driven sprocket  will cause a corresponding rotation of the seed dispensing mechanism  and, thus, will result in the seed planting machine  dispensing seed from the seed bin .In view of the above, and particularly with the lockout clutch  in the first configuration, when the seed planting machine  travels in a first direction, the ground-engaging mechanism  will rotate in the first direction. As a result, the driven component  of the ground-engaging mechanism, the first chain, the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch , the driven sprocket  of the lockout clutch , portions of the transmission system , and the drive component ( or ) of the seed dispensing mechanism  will all rotate in the first direction. The end result being that the seed dispensing mechanism  will rotate and dispense seed. Contrastingly, when the seed planting machine  travels in the second direction, the ground-engaging mechanism  will rotate in the second direction. As a result, and with the lockout clutch  in the first configuration, only the driven component  of the ground-engaging mechanism , the first chain, and the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch  will rotate in the second direction. The driven sprocket , the transmission system , the drive component ( or ), and the seed dispensing mechanism  will not be caused to rotate. The end result being that the seed dispensing mechanism  will not dispense seeds. In some embodiments, the first direction that the seed planting machine  travels will be a forward direction, and the second direction that the seed planting machine  travels will be a reverse direction. Thus, with the seed planting machine  configured in the first configuration, when the seed planting machine  travels forward, it is operable to dispense seeds. However, when the seed planting machine  travels in reverse, it is not operable to dispense seeds.With the lockout clutch  in the second configuration, the actuator  is not engaged with the catch plate , such that the driven sprocket  will not be caused to rotate in response to the drive sprocket  being rotated in either the first or second direction. As such, with the seed planting machine  configured in the second configuration, when the seed planting machine  travels in either the first or second directions, the ground-engaging mechanism  will rotate in the first or second directions, respectively, but only the driven component  of the ground-engaging mechanism , the first chain, and the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch  will be correspondingly caused to rotate in the first or second directions. The driven sprocket , the drive component ( or ), and the seed dispensing mechanism  will not be caused to rotate, such that the seed dispensing mechanism  will not dispense seeds. Thus, with the seed planting machine  configured in the second configuration, when the seed planting machine  travels forward or reverse, it is not operable to dispense seeds.As such, embodiments of the present invention include a method for planting seed with a seed planting machine. In particular, the method includes a seed planting machine, such as illustrated by seed planting machine  of , having the lockout clutch  with the actuator  for shifting the seed planting machine  between a first configuration and a second configuration. In more detail, and with reference to , the method includes the initial Step  of engaging the actuator  of the lockout clutch  to configure the seed planting machine  in the first configuration. The next Step  includes travelling in a first direction using the seed planting machine  configured in the first configuration, such that the lockout clutch  transmits rotational motion to the seed dispensing mechanism , thus causing the seed planting machine  to dispense seeds. Next Step  includes travelling in a second direction using the seed planting machine  configured in the first configuration, such that the lockout clutch  does not transmit rotational motion to the seed dispensing mechanism , thus causing the seed planting machine  to not dispense seeds. In a next Step , the actuator  of the lockout clutch  is disengaged, so as to configure the seed planting machine  in a second configuration. Upon disengaging the actuator  from the lockout clutch , the next Step  includes travelling in the first direction using the seed planting machine  configured in the second configuration, such that the lockout clutch  does not transmit rotational motion to the seed dispensing mechanism , thus causing the seed planting machine  to not dispense seeds. A final Step  includes travelling in the second direction using the seed planting machine  configured in the second configuration, such that the lockout clutch  does not transmit rotational motion to the seed dispensing mechanism , thus causing the seed planting machine  to not dispense seeds.Such a method for selectively dispensing seed from a seed planting machine  may be advantageous for situations in which the soil needs to be tilled, aerated, or otherwise conditioned before seed is planted therein. For example, the seed planting machine  may be initially configured in the second configuration, such that the seed planting machine  will travel in the first direction without planting seed. As such, the seed planting machine  can travel over the soil such that the roller mechanisms (e.g., the tiller rollers, aerator rollers, packer rollers, disc harrows, etc.) of the seed planting machine  will condition the soil without the seed planting machine  planting seeds. Once the seed planting machine  has sufficiently conditioned the soil, the seed planting machine  can be configured in the first configuration, such that the seed planting machine  will plant seed when travelling in the first direction (e.g., forward). Nevertheless, regardless of whether the seed planting machine  is in the first or second configuration, the seed planting machine  will not dispense seed (i.e., will not have its seed dispensing mechanism  driven to rotate) when travelling in the second direction (e.g., reverse). As such, embodiments of the present invention prevent the seed dispensing mechanism  from being damaged when the seed planting machine  is driven in reverse.In addition to the lockout clutch  being operable to selectively drive the seed dispensing mechanism , the lockout clutch  can similarly be configured to drive the seed mixing mechanism . In particular, drive component  of the seed mixing mechanism  may be linked, either directly or indirectly via the transmission system , with the lockout clutch . In particular, the transmission system  may link the driven sprocket  of the lockout clutch  with the drive component  of the seed mixing mechanism . However, it is understood that the drive component  and the lockout clutch  may not be directly linked, but instead, may be indirectly linked via one or more sprockets/sprocket assemblies and/or chains of the transmission system . Furthermore, in certain embodiments, such as illustrated in , it is contemplated that the drive component  of the seed mixing mechanism  may be linked with the drive component  of the seed dispensing mechanism . As such, when the seed dispensing mechanism  is caused to rotate, via the transmission system , such a rotation causes a simultaneous rotation of the seed mixing mechanism . Nevertheless, and regardless of how the seed mixing mechanism  and its drive component  are driven by the transmission system , with the lockout clutch  in the first configuration (i.e., the actuator  engaged with the catch plate ), a rotation of the drive sprocket  in the first direction will cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket  in the first direction. Contrastingly, a rotation of the drive sprocket  in the second direction will not cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket  in the second direction. Because the driven sprocket  is linked, directly or indirectly, with the drive component  of the seed mixing mechanism , a rotation of the driven sprocket  will cause a corresponding rotation of the drive component of the mixing mechanism , and, thus, a corresponding mixing of seeds within the seed bin .In other embodiments, the seed planting machine  will include two or more seed bins, with each operable to house seed. For instance, with reference to , seed planting machine  may include a second seed bin . Furthermore, as illustrated by , the second seed bin  may include a mixing mechanism , similar to the mixing mechanism  associated with the originally-described seed bin . In some embodiments, the mixing mechanism  will be rotated via a drive component , such as a sprocket, pulley, or a gear, which is integrally connected with an end of the mixing mechanism. The drive component  is integrally connected to the mixing mechanism , such that a rotation of the drive component causes a corresponding rotation of the mixing mechanism . Also similar to the seed bin , the second seed bin  will be associated with a seed dispensing mechanism  generally positioned adjacent to a lower portion and/or below the second seed bin . In some embodiments, the seed dispensing mechanism  will be rotated via a drive component , which is integrally connected with an end of the seed dispensing mechanism . As such, the drive component  is integrally connected to the seed dispensing mechanism , such that a rotation of the drive component  causes a corresponding rotation of portions of the seed dispensing mechanism .As such, embodiments of the present invention provide for planting a second type of seed from the seed planting machine . In particular, the seed planting machine  may hold a second type of seed located within the second seed bin . Similar to the method previously described with respect to selectively dispensing seed from the seed bin , the driven component  of the ground-engaging mechanism  may be linked with the lockout clutch  via a first chain. In particular, the first chain may be engaged with the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch . Furthermore, the drive component  of the seed dispensing mechanism  of the second seed bin  may be linked with the lockout clutch  directly or indirectly via a one or more additional chains and sprockets/sprocket assemblies of the transmission system . In particular, a second chain may be directly engaged between the driven sprocket  of the lockout clutch  and the drive component  of the seed dispensing mechanism . However, it is understood that in certain embodiments, such as shown in , the drive component  and the lockout clutch  may not be directly linked, but instead, may be indirectly linked via one or more sprockets/sprocket assemblies and/or chains of the transmission system .Nevertheless, a rotation of the ground-engaging mechanism  will cause a corresponding rotation of the driven component , which will cause the first chain to translate, thereby causing a corresponding rotation of the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch . As previously described, with the lockout clutch in the first configuration (i.e., the actuator  engaged with the catch plate ), a rotation of the drive sprocket  in the first direction will cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket  in the first direction. Contrastingly, a rotation of the drive sprocket  in the second direction will not cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket  in the second direction. Because the driven sprocket  is linked with the drive component  of the seed dispensing mechanism , either directly or indirectly, a rotation of the driven sprocket  will cause a corresponding rotation of the seed dispensing mechanism  and, thus, will result in the seed planting machine  dispensing seed from the second seed bin .In view of the above, and particularly with the lockout clutch  in the first configuration, when the seed planting machine  travels in a first direction, the ground-engaging mechanism  will rotate in the first direction. As a result, the driven component  of the ground-engaging mechanism, the first chain, the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch , the driven sprocket  of the lockout clutch, portions of the transmission system , and the drive component  of the seed dispensing mechanism  associated with the second seed bin  will all rotate in the first direction. The end result being that the seed dispensing mechanism  will rotate and dispense seed from the second seed bin . Contrastingly, when the seed planting machine  travels in the second direction, the ground-engaging mechanism  will rotate in the second direction. As a result, only the driven component  of the ground-engaging mechanism, the first chain, and the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch  will rotate in the second direction. The driven sprocket , the transmission system , the drive component , and the seed dispensing mechanism  associated with the second seed bin  will not be caused to rotate. The end result being that the seed dispensing mechanism  will not dispense seeds from the second seed bin  of the seed planting machine .With the lockout clutch  in the second configuration, the actuator  is not engaged with the catch plate , such that the driven sprocket  will not be caused to rotate in response to the drive sprocket  being rotated in either the first or second direction. As such, when the seed planting machine  travels in either the first or second directions, the ground-engaging mechanism  will rotate in the first or second directions, respectively, but only the driven component  of the ground-engaging mechanism , the first chain, and the drive sprocket  of the lockout clutch  will be correspondingly caused to rotate in the first or second directions. The driven sprocket , the drive component , and the seed dispensing mechanism  associated with the second bin  will not be caused to rotate. The end result being that the seed dispensing mechanism  will not dispense seeds from the second seed bin . Thus, when the seed planting machine  travels forward or reverse, it is not operable to dispense seeds from the second seed bin .In addition to the lockout clutch  being operable to selectively drive the seed dispensing mechanism  associated with the second seed bin , the lockout clutch can similarly be configured to drive the seed mixing mechanism  associated with the second seed bin. In particular, drive component  of the seed mixing mechanism  may be linked, either directly or indirectly via the transmission system , with the lockout clutch . In particular, the transmission system  may link the driven sprocket  of the lockout clutch  with the drive component  of the seed mixing mechanism . However, it is understood that the drive component  and the lockout clutch  may not be directly linked, but instead, may be indirectly linked via one or more sprockets/sprocket assemblies and/or chains of the transmission system . Furthermore, in certain embodiments, such as illustrated in , it is contemplated that the drive component  of the seed mixing mechanism  may be linked with the drive component  of the seed dispensing mechanism . As such, when the seed dispensing mechanism  and the drive component  are caused to rotate, via the transmission system , such a rotation causes a simultaneous rotation of the seed mixing mechanism . Nevertheless, and regardless of how the seed mixing mechanism  and its drive component  are driven by the transmission system , with the lockout clutch  in the first configuration (i.e., the actuator  engaged with the catch plate ), a rotation of the drive sprocket  in the first direction will cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket  in the first direction. Contrastingly, a rotation of the drive sprocket  in the second direction will not cause a corresponding rotation of the driven sprocket  in the second direction. Because the driven sprocket  is linked, directly or indirectly, with the drive component  of the seed mixing mechanism , a rotation of the driven sprocket  will cause a corresponding rotation of the drive component  of the mixing mechanism, and, thus, a corresponding mixing of seeds within the second seed bin .In certain embodiments, the transmission system  will include one or more drive components in the form of locking sprocket assemblies. Such locking sprocket assemblies will each broadly comprise two sprockets, including a first and a second sprocket, axially aligned so as to rotate about a common axle. Each locking sprocket assembly may include a retractable pin operable to couple the first and second sprockets. As such, with the pin engaged and the first and second sprockets coupled together, a rotation of the first sprocket, in either direction, will cause a corresponding rotation of the second sprocket. Similarly, a rotation of the second sprocket, in either direction, will cause a corresponding rotation of the first sprocket. However, with the pin not-engaged, the first and second sprockets will be decoupled, such that the first and second sprockets rotate independently.The transmission system  may include a locking sprocket assembly associated with each seed bin , . For instance, with reference to the embodiments illustrated in , the transmission system  may include a first locking sprocket  associated with seed dispensing mechanism . In particular, the first locking sprocket , with the pin of the locking sprocket engaged so as to couple the first and second sprockets together, is operable to transmit rotation from the transmission system  to the seed dispensing mechanism  of the seed bin . Alternatively, with the pin of the first locking sprocket  not engaged, the locking sprocket  is operable to not transmit rotation from the transmission system  to the seed dispensing mechanism  of the seed bin .Similarly, embodiments of the present invention provide for the transmission system  to include a second locking sprocket  associated with the seed dispensing mechanism  of the second seed bin . The second locking sprocket , with the pin of the locking sprocket  engaged so as to couple the first and second sprockets together, is operable to transmit rotation from the transmission system  to the seed dispensing mechanism  of the second seed bin . Alternatively, with the pin of the second locking sprocket  not engaged, the locking sprocket  is operable to not transmit rotation from the transmission system  to the seed dispensing mechanism  of the second seed bin .As such, in addition to the first and second configurations discussed above, the seed planting machine  is operable to be configured in a third and a fourth configuration. In particular, with the pin of the first locking sprocket  engaged and the pin of the second locking sprocket  not engaged, the seed dispensing machine is capable of being configured in the first or second configurations, as previously described, by engaging or disengaging the actuator  of the lockout clutch , respectively. As such, the seed planting machine  will selectively dispense seed from the seed bin , as previously described. Furthermore, however, with the pin of the first locking sprocket  engaged and the pin of the second locking sprocket  engaged, the seed planting machine  is capable of being configured in a third configuration. In such a configuration, the seed planting machine  is operable to selectively dispense seed from both the seed bin  and the second seed bin  simultaneously. Finally, with the pin of the first locking sprocket  not engaged and the pin of the second locking sprocket  engaged, the seed dispensing machine  is capable of being configured in a fourth configuration. In such a configuration, the seed planting machine  is operable to selectively dispense seed from only the second seed bin .Although the invention has been described with reference to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the attached drawings, it is noted that equivalents may be employed and substitutions made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. For example, although the above description and drawings describe the lockout clutch  being positioned on the seed planting machine  at a position set apart from the ground-engaging roller mechanism  and from the seed dispensing mechanism , it is understood that that the lockout clutch  can be positioned at other locations or can replace other components of the seed planting machine. For example, in certain embodiments, the lockout clutch  may be positioned on the end of the ground-engaging roller mechanism  in place of the driven component . Alternatively, the lockout clutch  may be positioned on the ends of either/both of the seed dispensing mechanisms ,  in place of the drive components , . In even further alternatives, the lockout clutch  may be positioned on the ends of either/both of the mixing mechanisms ,  in place of the drive components , . Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention may provide for the seed planting machine  to include a plurality of lockout clutches  positioned at various locations on the machine.As an additional example of an alternative embodiment of the present invention, in certain instances, the transmission system  may be driven by power sources other than the ground-engaging roller mechanism . For example, in certain instances, the seed planting machine  may include a hydraulic power system, an electrical power system, or a power take-off system. In certain embodiments, these other power systems may be coupled with the driven component , such that the lockout clutch  and the transmission system  may be selectively driven by such other power systems."

                "This disclosure claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/016,904, titled “System and Method to Monitor Gaseous Concentrations,” filed on Jun. 25, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.This disclosure relates generally to embodiments of monitoring gases from the injection of chemicals such as into the soil.As Earth's population is now over seven billion people and increasing rapidly, more food and natural resources are needed. Use of fertilizer and manure (or pesticides) would help increase crop yield and thus the amount of food. Fertilizer consumption depends on factors such as the choice of crops or forest plants, varieties and qualities of seeds, geography, rainfall, irrigation patterns, soil quality, farming methods, and sprayer and tillage technology and information. Although this disclosure is not limited to nutrients or even nitrogenous fertilizers, solutions or gases such as ammonia are familiar to most people with its pungent odor when the concentration of ammonia is high enough (over 50 ppm in air). Ammonia can be used in a reaction with carbon dioxide to produce urea. Ammonia nitrate can be produced through the combination of ammonia and nitric acid. Other fertilizer types produced on the base of ammonia include calcium ammonium nitrate (ammonium nitrate mixed with ground dolomite) and NP/NPK compound fertilizers.In an agricultural setting, the liquid or semi-liquid (gas) state of these fertilizers or nutrients may be sprayed close to the soil or applied directly into the soil by an applicator mechanism. A sharp ground-engaging tool such as a shank or disk first cuts through the ground and creates a furrow into which the compounds are subsequently deposited. Compounds like liquid anhydrous ammonia (NH) with a low boiling temperature point evaporate quickly and their fumes may linger in the air. There may also be tank leakages of ammonia compounds. Beginning at levels between 25-50 ppm, the fumes may cause some irritation. An end-user may not know when the gas in the atmosphere becomes a problem. Farmers also operate in a noisy environment that includes much vibrational motion (e.g. the tractor moving across uneven soil) where the compounds may be spread somewhat unevenly or in unpredicted parts of the soil.Embodiments of an agricultural or forestry implement include a ground engaging mechanism to introduce the chemicals or compounds into the soil and then a mechanism to detect the vapors emitted by the chemicals and to respond to an alarm condition. There is a vapor monitoring system for an agricultural implement, where the system includes a nutrient applicator that injects a compound into soil. Directly or indirectly above the nutrient applicator, there is a sensor that detects a gas corresponding to the compound in the soil. The vapor monitoring system is set up to generate an indication when a concentration of the gas passes a threshold. In some embodiments of an alarm state, the monitoring system generates an auditory or visual warning. In other embodiments, the monitoring system reduces or shuts down the release of the chemicals when there is an alarm condition. Yet other embodiments are described in the detailed description, drawings and claims.Nutrient (or pesticides) applicators inject compounds into the ground such as for agricultural purposes. In this disclosure, rather than try to monitor the nutrient (or pesticides) content in the soil, sensor apparatuses are mounted on the ground engaging implements to analyze the air above the soil and to detect volatilization of certain nutrients and fertilizers. Sensors are placed in strategic locations on an agricultural implement or vehicle. The sensors and associated electronics and software have a detection threshold based on a plume model (e.g. hydrodynamic movement of gas) or based on fixed thresholds or based on calculations. For example, if the measured atmospheric concentration of a gas such as anhydrous ammonia (NH) or methane during a ground engaging operation exceeds a threshold value, an alert indication (e.g. sound, flash, haptic technology) is generated. The application and detection of atmospheric anhydrous ammonia is described as an example, but the embodiments also apply to other chemicals or compounds that vaporize, even when toxicity is not an issue. For instance, the embodiments may be used as an alternative and fast way of measuring certain nutrients in the ground without having to take soil samples. The embodiments solve technical problems such as being able to measure with sufficient accuracy. The embodiments have attributes such as not being disturbed by weather conditions (e.g. wind) or machine motion and vibration, be simple and cost effective to implement and to use and maintain or calibrate, and be easy to integrate into existing machinery such as tractors and other vehicles.If the applied substance is anhydrous ammonia, it is usually directly injected as a crystal, liquid, semi-liquid into the ground before or after planting. Although soil is placed over the ammonia to prevent it from escaping, some of the liquid or semi-liquid tends to still escape as an aerosol or gas. The speed of vaporization and dispersion of the aerosol and gas depend on environmental factors such as the wind, weather (e.g. amount of humidity and temperature), and on terrain conditions on the downwind direction. For instance, cold temperatures tend to cause the vapors or cloud to remain close to the ground and slow the cloud dispersion; while warm air adds energy to the ammonia molecule, thus spreading it faster and creating a larger plume. Or, high wind tends to stream out the release, and moderate wind tends to maximize dispersion, especially if the upper air is warm. Consequently, sensing the gas and its concentration also entails calibration and normalization of the results depending on the environmental and physical conditions.In one embodiment,  depicts an example implement such as a compound application system  having a motorized, unmanned or autonomous vehicle  attached to a ground engaging tool  followed by another implement such as a compound applicator  at the rear end of the engaging tool . The autonomous vehicle  has a location sensor  (e.g. GPS/GNSS, camera, infrared), a wind sensor  (e.g. direction and speed), and an atmospheric sensor mounted (e.g. thermometer, barometer, humidity) near the upper front of the vehicle . Alternatively, precise mobile weather sensor stations are mounted on the equipment or vehicles having compound applicators. A gas sensor  is mounted at the upper rear of the autonomous vehicle at either fixed locations or at moveable or variable locations (e.g. on a rotatable rod). The compounds that are applied to the ground are, for example, chemical compounds, liquids, solids, or mists. In another embodiment, there is no ground engaging tool  for a no-till application or if the soil is already porous or opened enough to accept the compounds. The compound application system  has a device alert  such as a loudspeaker, a red light, vibration, blinking computer widget or some other device to provide a warning that a gas concentration in the atmosphere is too high or is at a dangerous level. In , the alert  is mounted on the vehicle . Alternatively, alert  is mounted near the gas sensor  so that the entire vapor monitoring system (e.g. alert , electronics and software and controller) is congregated near the gas sensor . On the other hand, if the software and electronics of the gas monitoring is performed remotely, the alert  is located at a remote computer or central computing unit . In , the applied material is located in a tank mounted on vehicle , but may also be towed in a separate tank. The vehicle  may also be driven by an operator.depicts another agricultural embodiment (e.g. forest, crop, winery) of the compound application system , agricultural assembly , to apply a nutrient such as anhydrous ammonia on an agricultural field (e.g. crops, forest, etc.). Alternatively, some pesticides may also be applied similarly in the following described manner. The agricultural assembly  has a manned or unmanned tractor  that pulls an agricultural implement or vehicle such as a field cultivator  (shown in greater detail in ). At the underside of the field cultivator , there are soil opening tools  such as coulters, disks or shanks that disturb and cut into the ground and create openings such as holes, slivers, slices, trenches or furrows in the soil. A nutrient applicator  is attached to and behind (or underneath) the field cultivator  with respect to the direction of travel of the agricultural assembly . The nutrient applicator  includes fingers or nutrient tubes  that direct nutrients into the soil. Although called a “tube,” the nutrient tubes  are alternatively tubular, conical, funnel-shaped, syringe or some other dispenser shape that can accurately place nutrients in a small area (e.g. within 1-2 inches of a desired location). Each of the nutrient tubes  has a tube opening  where nutrients are dispensed into the soil (see e.g. ). Also depending on the size and span-width of the tractor , more than one nutrient applicator  is attached to the rear of the tractor , either in the lateral direction (e.g. perpendicular to direction of travel) or in series such as when there are multiple types of nutrients that are not mixed together. In the example, agricultural assembly  has a rear hitch  to which heavy loads may be attached and pulled. For a fertilizer application, the load is a nutrient tank  that feeds nutrients into the nutrient applicators  via a feed duct . For instance, the nutrient tank  is a liquid anhydrous ammonia NHtank . Alternatively, tank  is mounted on the tractor . Regardless where tank  is located, there are manifolds  (see e.g. , chambers or device with valves and outlets to distribute the nutrients) mounted on cultivator  that directs or re-directs compounds to the appropriate corresponding nutrient applicators . If the manifolds  did not initially contain the compounds, the NHtank first releases the compounds to the manifolds  that hold the compounds temporarily before releasing them into the nutrient tubes  and then into the soil.In other configurations of an agricultural assembly , the nutrient applicator  follows a field planter or seeder or no-till air drill (not shown) that puts seeds into selected positions in rows of soil and covers the seeds with soil. In this configuration, the subsequent nutrient applicator  releases or sprays compounds near the seeds in a region adjacent to where the seeds are planted. Alternatively, for some compounds, the nutrient applicator  may also precede a field planter. The nutrient applicator  first injects the compound into the soil, which is then followed by seed planting. For example, in a no-till planter application, a compound of starter fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia are mixed together and put into tanks on the field planter and optionally also on a trailer towed behind the field planter. Through a coulter or disk having an associated nutrient dispenser, the compound is injected and placed near the seed (e.g. about 1-3 inches away from the seed). In these embodiments with field planters, both the fertilizer and seeds are effectively placed into the soil during one drive pass through the field. In any of these embodiments of the agricultural assembly , there is also a gas detector system .In , an example gas detector system  is mounted to the agricultural assembly . The gas detector system  includes for example, NH3 or other types of gas sensors . For monitoring the gas from the ground, the detector system  is located generally above the nutrient applicator  (not shown) in , but located between and ahead of a pair of closing disks  with respect to the direction of travel. The detector system  is either directly or indirectly above the nutrient applicator , such as behind and above the nutrient applicator  at an angle (0-80 degrees from vertical). For more general monitoring (e.g. if the NH3 tank  has a spill or leak), the gas sensor  can be mounted anywhere near a source of the anhydrous ammonia. In a different embodiment, the location of the detector system  is mechanically adjustable in order to optimally sense the gas, to adapt to the environmental factors or terrain factors (e.g. hill or flat plain) that may cause the vapors from the fertilizer to remain closer or farther from the ground or follow the wind direction. For example, the gas sensor  is attached to a magnet or fastener and can be readily re-located anywhere near the anhydrous NH3 source as conditions change or a need arises. Alternatively, the detector system  is on a rotatable plate or fixture that is fixed in location via nuts, bolts, epoxy, etc., but the detector system's  location and orientation are adjustable automatically through computer-control.In some embodiments, the gas sensors  are mounted on the rear hitch  to which nutrient applicators  are tied (ahead of each pair of closing disk ). Alternatively, the gas sensors  are strapped or mounted to a brace  for the NH3 tank . Since the anhydrous ammonia is volatile and temperature monitored, its temperature is kept within a certain range by a NH3 cooler (not shown) that is often located near the bottom (or underside) of the NH3 tank . The gas sensors  can also be mounted in the front and back of the NH3 cooler. Since there are often multiple gas sensors , they can be temporarily mounted to many locations, on the tractor , on a cart for the NH3 tank , and so on. Moreover, to quantitatively monitor the effectiveness of a nutrient application for each row of plants or crops, each finger (e.g. nutrient tube ) of the nutrient applicator  is associated with a gas sensor . More specifically, an agricultural assembly  or field cultivator  has a row of or multiple soil opening tools  followed by corresponding nutrient applicators , although for simplicity, the figures depict only a single finger (e.g. nutrient tube ) of the nutrient applicator . For such configurations, depending on how far apart the nutrient tubes  or multiple nutrient applicators  are located, there is a single corresponding gas sensor  for each nutrient tube  or each nutrient applicator  or a shared gas sensor  for a number of nutrient tubes  or nutrient applicators . An optimal number of gas sensors  is determined a priori through field tests under various environmental and equipment configurations suitable for a field or fields in a particular region that may have similar soil and crops or vegetation. For example for plume cone calculations, multiple sensors  are placed at locations around the periphery where the cone is predicted to form.depicts another example detector system  mounted on the field cultivator  or other part of the agricultural assembly . There is at least one gas sensor  mounted on each rank  of the cultivator  to monitor the gas escaping in that lateral row (transverse to the direction of travel). In this example, the gas sensor  is mounted on the cultivator frame . In other embodiments, there may be more than one gas sensor  for each ground engaging tool . The gas sensor  sends its data and any computational results to a detector computing unit . The design choice for the configuration of the detector system  depends on a variety of factors such as the cost of the gas sensors  relative to the desired spatial and temporal granularity of the data collected. In some embodiments, a single gas sensor  collects data for several rows. In the example of , there are seven ground engaging tools  and four inlet samplers  for gas sensor . Each inlet sampler  is located near (5-20 inches) the tube opening  of nutrient tubes  (not shown, underneath ground engaging tool . Corresponding to each inlet sampler  is a gas flow tube , one end of which is connected to the particular inlet sampler . The other end of the gas flow tube  connects and inputs to valves  that feed gas flow into the gas sensor . The liquid flow tubes  are made of flexible material such as rubber, plastic or malleable metal. Opposite the direction of travel, behind the gas sensor , a fan  is mounted on frame . In operation, for the configuration of , the detector computing unit  optionally selects which gas flow tube  completes the pneumatic circuit. The fan  draws air through the set of gas flow tubes  past gas sensor . Air is induced (sucked) into gas flow tubes  from the vicinity of the inlet samplers , past gas sensors , through fan , and then discharged through an outlet . Through multiplexing, detector computing unit  selectively collects data from another gas flow tube  and stores the data for subsequent computation of the level of any noxious gas. The configuration of  improves the spatial resolution of the data collected for one gas sensor  and also permits averaging over the data collected or permits detection of a faulty channel (e.g. gas flow tube ). Optionally, gas flow tubes  are equipped with an air or dust filter or filter for other materials to prevent fouling or blockage of the gas sensor .depict other embodiments of the detector system  where gas flow is collected from all inlets simultaneously, rather than multiplex from one channel to another. In , the inlet samplers  (or gas sensors ) are positioned after the tube openings  of the nutrient tubes  (not shown on ), parallel to the direction of travel. In , the inlet samplers  are positioned transverse to the direction of travel. In , the inlet samplers  are staggered or placed in numerous positions located at or surrounding the tube openings . The patterns of  are useful to compensate for a gas pattern relative to the sensor for various directions of travel and wind conditions. The positions of inlet samplers  or gas sensors  are adjustable manually (e.g. re-attachment by magnetic material, adhesive, or mechanical fastener) or the multitude of devices are each pointed in different directions relative to one another so as to be able to catch the gas stream regardless of the changing direction of the vehicle . Alternatively, the inlet samplers  are plugged into a rotatable spindle mount or moveable sensor arms.Turning now to embodiments of the gas sensors , a few companies make small gas monitors. For instance, PCE Instruments make hand-held battery-operated Gasman meters about 2-3 inches in length and width that have integrated electronics and alarms. The devices warn with a penetrating sound and an optical signal (useful in case when there are loud noises in the surroundings) of the existence of dangerous gas concentrations and show on a tablet or computer screen the value of the gas measurement. In addition the PCE gas meter is able to save measurements and transmit them wirelessly to a computer for evaluation. The Gasman can detect twelve gases, ammonia, sulfides, carbons (from about 0 to 100 ppm for ammonia) and the alarm is set at 25 ppm. For an agricultural application, the gas sensor  could include a less expensive form of the Gasman, to detect only one or a few gases and mounted to a magnet or fastener or a bolt so as to easily be placed near the nutrient tubes , rear hitch  or nutrient tank  or . Alternatively, gas sensor  includes smaller ammonia gas detectors about 1 inch by 1 inch in width and length such as those made by SOS Electronics, Sensidyne or Sierra Monitor. These monitors have an ion-selective electrode that converts the activity of a specific ion dissolved in a small amount of solution into an electrical potential, a voltage that can be amplified by an analog amplifier. The voltage depends on the ionic activity. The sensing part of the electrode is usually made as an ion-specific membrane, along with a reference electrode. The voltage is proportional to the concentration of the ions. By careful calibration, these monitors can be adjusted to be sensitive to the 0-100 ppm level and also be mounted on magnets, fastener or a bolt for attachment purposes.Another embodiment of the gas sensor  includes a Delphi ammonia sensor that detects ammonia within a range of 0 to 100 ppm. If the sensor detects too much ammonia, it signals the system to reduce the amount of the urea injection. The planar alumina substrate in the Delphi ammonia sensor combines an integral temperature sensor with a thick-film heater for optimum performance. The Delphi ammonia sensor provides measurement of ammonia without interference from other elements in the atmosphere. Yet another option for measuring NH3 concentration is to employ an engine exhaust nitric oxide sensors such as those manufactured by Continental. These sensors are sensitive to both nitric oxide and NH3. The sensors usually do not discriminate between the two molecules. Only trace amounts of nitric oxide usually exist in the atmosphere, thus allowing nitric oxide sensors to also be suitable for use in measuring NH3. The Delphi ammonia sensor is modified to mount on a magnet or fastener or bolt for easy placement on the agricultural assembly  or compound application system .In various example embodiments, the gas sensors  are powered through electrical wire or locally via battery or energy harvesting. Energy sources include battery charging from operating the motor/engine of the autonomous or tractor . Alternatively, as sensors and supporting electronics become smaller and more efficient, the gas sensor  is wireless and powered through energy harvesting. One example of energy harvesting is solar power.In some example embodiments, the gas sensors  (or ) are wired or wireless for communications with the detector system  or with the autonomous, tractor , or even with a remote location. In the wired version, the gas sensors  have an electrically-wired (e.g. through CAN bus or some other vehicle bus standard) connection to a central processing unit  that is on the cab  of the tractor  (see ). The central processing unit  includes an electronic computer along with analog trip circuits or threshold detectors; or analog to digital converters (ADC) followed by digital processing circuits such as a microprocessor, microcontroller, logic circuits, calculators, programmable devices, programmable logic units, arithmetic logic units, pattern recognition circuits, memory circuits and buffer circuits, and so on. In other embodiments, the gas sensors  have local computation capability through sensor logic unit  (e.g. ) or the gas sensors  are in electrical communication with a detector computing unit  located in the detector system  but not physically attached to a gas sensor . These processor devices, the central processing unit , detector computing unit  or local sensor logic unit  have wireless or electrical communication (e.g. through CAN bus or separate wiring) with the alert  or the nutrient applicators  or feed ducts  to control them in the event of an alarm situation where the concentration of a gas exceeds a tolerated threshold. For instance, the alert  flashes or sounds a warning, and/or the application of the chemical or compound is reduced or ceased.In an embodiment where the communications are performed wirelessly, for example, connections to a central processing unit  that is on the cab  of the tractor  are based on wireless protocols (e.g. 802.11 WIFI or 802.15.1 Bluetooth). Together with computations and analysis, central processing unit  is set up as a local wireless hotspot having a wireless transmitter and receiver or an integrated mobile router. By adding a wireless transmitter and receiver to a controller for the nutrient applicator  and to the sensor logic unit  for the gas sensors , these devices would have to ability to communicate with the central processing unit  or among themselves. Alternatively, even on a single tractor  itself, there may exist both wireless and wired communication among the different devices on the tractor  or agricultural assembly . There are other ways to partition the communication system that would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. For instance, if the central processing unit  is not on the tractor , but in a remote location such as the farmhouse, there may already exist a WIFI router at the house that can perform the functions of a hub or hotspot, integrate and transfer all the communication information, for example, from one tractor  to another object. In yet another embodiment, there are additional tractors or agricultural assemblies operating in the field and people on those tractors may be alerted when there is a gas concentration alarm. For these remote communications, wireless or radio communication is used. In another embodiment, gas sensors  are monitored and managed by an external source so that information can be downloaded and uploaded from the sensors . New thresholds are sent to the gas sensors  to adapt them to changing conditions or sensors  are able to send signals to other sensors.In embodiments where the compound application system  injects organic waste (e.g. manure) or sludge, the amount of detected ammonia or methane is proportional to the odor from the sludge. In the event the aggregate amount of methane detected is too high, the injection rate is decreased to keep odors within acceptable limits. Similarly, if the methane level is low, the injection rate may be increased subject to other control constraints and parameters such as a nutrient (e.g. phosphorus) or salt application rate. Such manure or sludge sensor is made by Delphi, among others.depicts a close up view of an arrangement of the gas sensors  near a fertilizer (or pesticide) opener assembly . Assembly  includes a frame  carrying a soil opener  for opening a trench in the soil in which one or more selected fertilizer types are deposited (e.g., dry, liquid and/or gaseous fertilizer). Soil opener  includes an opener disc  and fertilizer dispensers . Frame  includes a linkage that is biased in a downward direction with a compression coil spring. A depth adjuster (e.g. pin lock or bolts) moves the vertical orientation of the opener disc  to adjust the cutting depth of opener disc  into the soil. Likewise, the height of the fertilizer dispensers  is also adjustable so that nutrients are embedded into the soil at different depths. Accordingly, a height or position of a corresponding detector system  or gas sensors  is also adjusted either automatically (e.g. if the detector system  is mounted on a moveable arm or ledge that is in electrical communication with the tractor controller) or adjusted by human operator manually free of tools (e.g. velcro, magnet, fastener).Another possible sensor  is available as an integrated circuit such as a micro gas chromatograph formed as an on-chip device. Its separation column, where the gas interacts with a polymer coated on the interior walls, is about the size of a quarter, and the thermal conductive detector is about half the size of a penny. When the two are combined, the combination device is about the size of a small rectangular 9-V battery. Such small sensors  and corresponding integrated circuitry are clipped or attached to some part of the agricultural implement such as a cultivator, primary and secondary tillage tools (e.g. rippers, plows, disks, etc.), or to the tractor  and cab  or hood of the tractor , to where noxious gas may travel.In some embodiments, in addition to the gas sensors , there are other sensors onboard a tractor  or vehicle  such as depicted in ; additional information is analyzed in determining an over-gas condition. The path of a gas from the ground to the gas sensors  will be impacted by the velocity (speed and direction) of the tractor  relative to the velocity of the surrounding atmosphere (wind). A local wind sensor (e.g. ) and other atmospheric sensors  are mounted on the front of the autonomous vehicle  or tractor . Alternatively, weather data is obtained wirelessly from local weather stations in a way similar to weather-band radio or on cellular phones. Information about the velocity, position and orientation of the tractor  is obtained from a variety of instruments on the tractor ; it has accelerometers, gyroscopes and GNSS/GPS receivers (not shown). Then, the directional information about tractor  and information about the wind velocity are input to the detector computing unit  to aid in the selection of which gas sensors  or inlet sampler  to use so that the direction for detecting a gas is optimal.Both the gas sensor  (or ), or an inlet to the gas sensor  may be moved or rotated to provide an optimal presentation to the gas such as directly facing an oncoming gas plume. Changes in the orientation is achieved through a pan-tilt mount (not shown), such as for cameras. In another example, at least one sensor  is rotated or moved to different locations in order to be in a better position to measure the release of gases depending on the nature of the terrain, the climate, wind direction and so on. Further the monitoring location can be extended by attaching the sensor  on an end of a rotatable rod or disk, thus extending the reach of the sensor .In some example embodiments, the fixed and movable gas sensors  are positioned to support either monitoring gas escape from the ground or monitoring and localizing an equipment problem such as a broken coupling or disconnected hose. Further, gas sensor  can also monitor the soil directly for a moisture content of the soil and the percentage of anhydrous ammonia in the moisture or vapor.depicts example embodiments of the operation  of . In block , the ground engaging tool  first opens the soil so that the compounds are more readily put into the ground. For instance, the ground engaging tool  is a machine with claws or cutters that grinds the soil on a first pass over the field or forest. In block , a stand-alone compound applicator  passes over the same field or forest and inserts compounds into the soil. In block , after the compound is released into the soil, the compound applicator  is followed by wheels or blades angled so as to move or drag soil to cover over the compounds. Although the compounds are covered by soil, gas from the compounds may still seep through the soil or escape if the compounds are buried in only a shallow amount of soil (e.g. less than 4-5 inches) or if the compounds are not covered fast enough. For example, chilled, liquid anhydrous ammonia is injected into the ground but it vaporizes at a low temperature so that as soon as it is released and touches the warm ground and atmosphere, it will vaporize. The compound application system  also includes a gas sensor  that was set up to detect a gaseous state of the compound. In operation , there is also gas monitoring. Prior to operating in a field, in block , the gas monitoring computer (e.g.  or  that is located in or near the gas sensor , or in the autonomous vehicle  or at a remote computer) is calibrated to detect a particular gas and programmed with a concentration threshold. For example, a look-up table contains calibration constants and information so that for each atmospheric condition (e.g. wind, pressure, humidity, temperature), a particular value or range of values of gas concentration is deemed harmful or wasteful (e.g. too much nutrients). The gas sensor  is programmed to provide an indication, e.g. trip an alarm, set off a flash of light, or register a warning sound if the gas sensor  detects a gas beyond an a priori selected threshold level. For anhydrous ammonia, the threshold level is set in the range of 50-100 ppm as a single threshold number or as a set of numbers in the lookup table. Alternatively, the compound applicator  is programmed to automatically stop releasing the compound or accordingly reduces the amount of compound released when the gas detected surpasses multiple threshold levels. In block , when the autonomous vehicle is traversing the ground, the gas sensor  is turned on to detect the amount of gas in the atmosphere. The gas sensor checks for the gas concentration at different elevation levels above compound applicator . In block , the gas monitoring computer (e.g.  or ) performs a lookup or comparison whether the detected gas concentration surpasses the pre-set danger thresholds (greater than or less than depending on the choice of logic set up). In block , if a threshold is exceeded, an alarm status is flagged and an alarm sounds or flashes from alert . Alternatively or in conjunction, the compound applicator  reduces or stops releasing the compound. In another embodiment, the response to an alarm status is tiered, or that there are variable action thresholds. For example, if the concentration of anhydrous ammonia is above 50 ppm, then a warning (e.g. sound or flash from alert ) is issued, but if the concentration is above 100 ppm, then compound application is reduced, and if the concentration is above 150 ppm, then the application is ceased. Likewise, if the gas sensor  or  detects other gases (e.g. methane) or multiple gases, different thresholds and responses can be programmed into the memory circuits of the gas monitoring computer (e.g.  or ). In different embodiments, the programming is performed at manufacturing, or even on the fly when a person is in the field and tailors the choice of thresholds to particular plants and field conditions.In another embodiment, block  includes computations instead of or in addition to using lookup tables to determine acceptable gas concentrations and alarm conditions. Different models of dispersion of a gas in atmosphere are obtained through experiments or through simulation of how pollutants react in the atmosphere. For instance, climatologists, the air-force and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provide models such as AERMOD, CALPUFF, BLP, CALINE3, ADAM, HOTMAC, and so on. These models contain equations and/or lookup tables that take inputs or measurements of ground or atmospheric conditions (e.g. terrain, elevation, wind turbulence, etc.) and predicts how a gas would disperse under such conditions. These equations and lookup tables are programmed into the gas monitoring computer  and stored in the memory circuit of the gas monitoring computer  to accept sensor inputs and generate predicted outputs. The sensors (e.g. , , , ) provide measurement data to the gas monitoring computer where the equations are stored and computations are made. The gas monitoring computer  calculates and generate and outputs predicted gas concentration data that are then compared with acceptable threshold levels. For example, the product (rate of dispersion×time=predicted distance traveled) yields an estimate of the path/distance of travel of gas from the ground surface to the gas sensor  or . A model of this dispersion is used in combination with the vector travel path to estimate the gas concentration at the point of origin relative to the concentration measured at the sensor. As an example, the dispersion could be modeled as a normal distribution about the path vector with the standard deviation increasing proportional to the distance the gas travels from the ground to the gas sensor  or  (expanding dispersion). If the detected or actually measured gas concentration exceeds the predicted, expected acceptable amount, the alarm condition is then set and, accordingly, the amount of compounds released may be reduced or stopped, or an alarm goes off to alert the farmer or remote operator. In an example embodiment, the equipment is automatically positioned relative to the wind to facilitate mitigation or repair of an equipment problem.In other embodiments of block , calculation of NH3 plumes from spills or other excesses is performed using ALOHA and PEAC tools. In an example embodiment, a plume modeling tool is used to develop a conical volume model for the plume that contains some percentage of NH3 released within the volume at a particular height above the source of the NH3, such as at 90% height of the plume cone, for particular environmental factors considered by the model, and for a period of time such as four to five seconds. Within this volume there can be other iso-surfaces such as at 50% or 10% surface. There may also be a line representing the center of the distribution. The line may be straight, segmented, curved, and so on. Rather than represent a percent of material, the iso-surfaces may alternatively represent a percentage of a maximum gas concentration reading. This calculation is repeated for each nutrient or compound source injection point across an applicator, if there are multiple sources of nutrients or compounds released.In yet other embodiments of block , if not taken into account as part of the original modeling, the calculated cones are oriented to receive measurements such as the current applicator speed and wind speed. When there is little or no-wind, the plume would typically rise straight up. But if there is some wind, the calculated cones are tipped or slanted at an angle from vertical.The contributions of NH3 from each calculated cone for a point in space and time are added together. In one implementation, the conical volumes are each represented as non-zero values in a three dimensional matrix and the elements added together. The result is a new volume of total gas concentrations across the compound application system  or agricultural assembly . This total gas concentration volume has multiple potential uses. In one example, data from fixed sensors on the periphery of the plume can be used to estimate levels elsewhere in the plume and the total NH3 escaping. For instance, the measured values from three sensors may be used to estimate gas amounts elsewhere in the cone volume.In other embodiments, such as where a plume model is not available, a movable sensor may scan a plane or volume to measure gas concentration and build a 2D or 3D model of that concentration. If a plume model is available, the scanned data may be used to validate or tune the model for the operating environment.depicts an example operation  of an example detector system  together with an example agricultural assembly . In block , gas sensing occurs and generates raw analog gas concentration data (e.g. ions on an electrode, microscopic chemical reaction of gas molecules on semiconductor metal oxide material). In block , communications between members of the detector system  with the autonomous or tractor  or even with a remote location, is performed either wired or wirelessly. Detector system  communicates raw analog gas concentration data to a computing device such as the central computing unit  or detector computing unit  or sensor logic unit  that processes and converts the raw signal into a gas concentration value at a location over a lateral row of crops or plants. The gas sensors  have an electrically-wired (e.g. through CAN bus or some other vehicle bus standard) or wireless (e.g. local WIFI hotspot) connection to a central computing unit  that is on the cab  of the tractor . Alternatively, the central computing unit  is located away from the cab  but still on the tractor  (e.g. a semi-autonomous tractor), or located in a remote location in which case there is wireless communication (e.g. 802.11 WIFI) between the gas sensors  and the computing unit  through signal transceivers. An alternative configuration is that the detector system  has a detector computing unit  that locally receives and processes all of the sensing information from the individual gas sensors . Gas sensors  communicate either wirelessly or by electrical wire with the detector computing unit  that controls each gas sensor .In block , regardless of which computing device performs the calculations and comparisons, the device decides whether there is an alarm condition, whether the collected sensed gas information is past certain thresholds. Either the detector computing unit  or the central computing unit  also tracks historical or time-varying information, which allows for calibrations and corrections for hysteresis and stray erroneous reads from the gas sensors . In block , if there is an alarm state, the computing units  or  rapidly (e.g. milliseconds) shut off the delivery of the NH3 liquid and alert a person about dangerous gas. In another embodiment of the partitioning of the data computation and processing, each gas sensor  itself has a feedback loop, processing and control circuitry or an algorithm in a local sensor logic unit . Such local feedback and control enable a gas sensor  to quickly shut off the delivery of the NH3 liquid and alert a person about dangerous vapors.Example operation  occurs regardless of the partitioning of the responsibility to process and make decisions among the local sensor logic unit  or the detector computing unit  or central computing unit . The sensing element such as chemical sensing onto electrodes is generally an analog signal that can be converted by an ADC and the digital signals are then analyzed and stored in memory circuit, compared with the value of an alarm threshold, notify an alarm condition, and so on. Alternatively, the sensor and alarm indicator are analog circuits (amplifier, comparator, output driver) processing analog signals and an analog comparator trips when the sensed signal is past a threshold and an alarm or other warning goes off. Data processing includes embodiments such as threshold detection if the sensed gas passes some pre-set limit for toxicity (e.g. 50-100 ppm). To avoid false alarms, hysteresis or some other method such as time averaging several values together or digital or analog filtering is included to pre-process the signals before comparator and threshold detection.In , the example operation  also includes the functionality of the agricultural assembly  that travels up to high speeds (e.g. over 10-15 miles per hour), with low-draft characteristics to enable faster injection of anhydrous ammonia such as to cover over 50 acres an hour. Optionally, in block , there are ground engaging tools (e.g. drills, coulters, shanks, disks) that open the soil, create narrow trenches or drill holes in the soil. The soil opener  cuts a groove in the soil. In block , the nutrient applicator  releases or propels compounds like NHinto the soil openings. NH3 is metered from an NH3 tank , dividing the liquid NH3 into multiple streams using a manifold . The streams are conveyed to outlets associated with each soil opener  mounted on field cultivator . As the liquid NH3 traverses the tubes  and manifolds , it heats up due to friction effects and may already start to vaporize so that a gaseous-liquid phase of the anhydrous ammonia is delivered out of the tube openings . If the tubes  or manifolds  are chilled, the compound tends to remain in the liquid state. The nutrient applicator  places nitrogen fertilizer under the soil surface and seals it there, reducing the risk of volatilization (if the anhydrous ammonia is not already in a gas phase) and surface runoff during rainfall events or under high winds (e.g. over 20 miles per hour). The anhydrous ammonia is placed about 4 to 8 inches into the soil.In block , closing tools or closing disks  at the rear of agricultural assembly  or at the rear of the compound applicator  or feed duct  pushes soil back over the openings, covering the compounds. The NH3 is bound into the soil after the agricultural assembly  passes over the soil. In practice, the desired amount of NH3 is sometimes not bound to the soil for reasons such as equipment malfunction that causes NH3 to escape directly in the air without reaching the outlet, a lack of a good seal over the fertilizer after it is deposited, or soil conditions. Rather than monitor the retention of the chemicals in the soil, one embodiment is to monitor and analyze the air above the soil and attempt to distinguish particular gas as belonging to a substance such as NH3. If there is an alarm state in block  due to an over concentration of NH3 gas in the air, then block  responds accordingly to reduce or stop the flow of nutrients or to signal an alert .In some embodiments of block  using a centralized processor  that performs many tasks, the central processor  runs a state machine or scheduler to periodically check the status of the sensors . Alternatively, the central processor  can be programmed to be automatically interrupted by urgent signals indicating a presence of a dangerous gas, and then the central processor  can send a signal to, for example, alert  to issue an indication of a problem.In some embodiments of block , the processor circuit compares the value of individual or aggregated gas sensor  readings to a threshold value or set of thresholds. If the threshold values are exceeded, the processor circuit flags a status bit to generate an alerting signal or perform tiered shutdown of released chemicals. During manufacturing, descriptions of such procedures and how to hook up the equipment are included in the operator manuals to instruct the end-users. Alternatively, assembly manuals also advise manufacturing employees or customers and end-users how to mount the gas sensors and where to mount the sensors relative to a direction of travel or relative to where the chemical applicators are placed. For instance, the gas sensors should be positioned where they can capture the drift of the ammonia under various weather conditions.In some embodiments of block , the processor circuit adjusts the values of the raw gas sensor , by taking into account position and time information from GNSS/GPS receivers regarding the gas sensors . The adjusted data values are stored locally in a data file or memory circuit and wirelessly transmitted to another machine on the field or to a remote location. The data may also be displayed to a tractor operator or remote operator so that the operator can make real-time decisions as to what to do about the existing gaseous information in a particular region. If there is interference and the GPS/GNSS does not deliver accurate location readings, then instead of or in addition to geo-referencing the data, the data may also be phytoreferenced. Phytoreferencing is useful for NH3 applications (e.g. side-dressing) when small plants are present.Finally, the orientation and directions and positions stated and illustrated in this disclosure should not be taken as limiting. Many of the orientations stated in this disclosure or claims are with reference to the direction of travel of the equipment. But, the directions, e.g. “behind” can also are merely illustrative and do not orient the embodiments absolutely in space. That is, a structure manufactured on its “side” or “bottom” is merely an arbitrary orientation in space that has no absolute direction. Also, in actual usage, for example, the equipment may be operated or positioned at an angle because the implements may move in many directions on a hill; and then, “top” is pointing to the “side.” Further, for the unmanned autonomous vehicle , another configuration is place the compound applicator  in front of the autonomous vehicle  and all of the sensors, including the gas sensor , on the autonomous vehicle . There is little danger to humans if vehicle  is unmanned. Thus, the stated directions in this application may be arbitrary designations.Additionally, although this disclosure focuses on nitrous fertilizers, phosphate and sulfuric fertilizers may also be monitored. In addition to fertilizers, pesticides may also be treated in a similar manner. A sensor system is situated on various possible agricultural implements or assemblies such as a nutrient applicator, a ground engaging tool, applicant tank, or an agricultural vehicle or self propelled sprayers. Also the farming or forestry vehicles are manned or unmanned in alternative embodiments depending on the type of plant or application (e.g. crops, winery, orchards, trees). Various features are set forth in the following claims."

                "Developments in the plant propagation and perennial crop production industry have generated the need for an efficient planting system. One arena of vegetative propagation includes planting live processed rhizomes, tubers, nodal stem cuttings, or cane pieces. The present invention has been developed for these types of plant propagules, such as Rhizomes of or ; Cane pieces such as sugar cane, Miscanes, Napiergrass, Energy Cane and crops such as Potatoes and Horseradish. Giant () (M×g) will be discussed herein to exemplify the use of the invention, but the machine and its use are not limited to Giant , and references to rhizomes herein should be interpreted to include such tubers, nodal stem cuttings or cane pieces. Much background information on the cultivation of can be obtained from “Planting and Managing Giant as a Biomass Energy Crop,” U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Plant Materials Program, Technical Note No. 4, July 2011, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference (hereinafter referred to as “NRCS publication.)M×g used in this crop demonstration is a sterile hybrid, warm-season perennial grass that is native to Asia. The variety is commercially known as ‘Freedom’ (See U.S. Plant Patent Publication PP 23,489, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). It can produce large amounts of biomass, across several temperate latitudes, due to its high range of adaptability in both warm and cool climates, and in various soil types.Sterile M×g propagates and grows from rhizomes, and is becoming widely accepted for various agriculture and bio-renewable products. Underground rhizomes can range from a few (20-40) to several hundred per plant depending on age, growing environment, and genetics of the individual genotype or clone. These parameters are the focus of efforts in regards to growing, digging rhizomes for seeding new fields, processing of rhizomes, and planting the crop.Solid and efficient establishment of any vegetative propagated crop is to for the crop's success. Challenges in the establishment of rhizome planted crops like M×g include weed competition, and provision of healthy viable rhizomes, planting date, and moisture availability. It is most important that stand density and subsequent plant populations are adequate for optimizing yield. Dense stands require little or no weed control after the establishment year.In general, if not directly transplanted from rhizome harvest, rhizomes can be stored and not lose viability for a period of time, depending on storage conditions. Proper temperature and moisture levels during storage are may be critical to maintaining viability. Fields typically can be planted between February and June, depending upon latitude, soil temperature and soil moisture level, while being mindful that frost damage can occur. Rhizomes should be planted between 3 and 4 inches deep in moist soil. Planting rates can vary, depending upon many factors. The desired final population is between 6000-10,800 plants per acre, with the quantity depending on soil quality and water availability. This usually requires planting a minimum of 6,000 rhizomes per acre. Recommended spacing varies between 36-inch rows by 36-inch spacing; 30-inch rows with 30-inch spacing; 30-inch rows by 24-inch spacing; or 24-inch rows by 24-inch spacing, depending on plant population density required for an optimal stand. Modified corn planters, potato planters, carousel planters and vegetable planters have been recommended to be used to plant rhizomes. These recommendations are not of the device described herein. After planting rhizomes, the field should be rolled to ensure good soil contact with the rhizomes.Giant can be harvested with a silage harvester, or mowed and baled. Regardless of the harvest method used, a 2-4 inch stubble height is recommended to maximize yield, but avoid picking up the leaf litter.Rhizome Quality—Age of mother plants affects rhizome quality and rhizome quality affects stand establishment. In one European study cited in the NRCS publication, survival was 88 percent with rhizome pieces from 5-year-old plants compared to only 25 percent for rhizomes from 1-year-old plants and 52 percent for rhizomes from 9-year-old plants. Preliminary work in Mississippi has shown better rhizome quality from 2-year-old plants than from 4-year-old plants. These studies indicate that quality of rhizome increases with mother plant age, but only up to a certain point.For field planting, according to the NRCS publication, a plantable quantity of rhizomes should weigh about 1.5 to 2 ounces (50 g) and the rhizomes should be about 4 to 5 inches long, but can be smaller depending on variety and species type where smaller or larger rhizomes maintain acceptable viability. Rhizome quantity per drop is adjusted to ensure good establishment while reducing the risk of amount to excess surplus and waste. For M×g, good quality rhizomes pieces can be branched or unbranched pieces, and should appear scaly and buff colored. Typically they will have small feeder roots attached. Those feeder roots can entangle with the roots of adjacent rhizomes in a bulk container.Rhizome Yield—Age of mother plant also affects rhizome yield according to the NRCS publication. Hand dug, 1-year-old plants were found to produce 7 to 10 harvestable rhizomes, 2-year-old plants produced 25 to 30 harvestable rhizomes, and 3-year-old plants produced 75 to 80 harvestable rhizomes (Pyter et al. 2009). Yield of mechanically dug rhizomes is not as high. The European rule of thumb is that for each acre of 4-year-old mother field, one can expect enough rhizomes to plant 8 to 10 acres.Digging Considerations—Rhizomes can be dug anytime in the fall or winter period after the plants have senesced and biomass removed. However, the most common time for harvesting for field planting is in the spring prior to shoot emergence. Rhizomes should be used as soon as possible after digging, but they can be stored temporarily if kept cool and moist. This can be accomplished by covering the rhizome heap with moist soil, but it is critical that the rhizomes not be allowed to dry out or go through a heat. Additionally, care should be taken to not let rhizomes dry out during transport.Depending on planting method used, the rhizomes also may need to be cleaned and sized. Sizing is particularly critical to ensure rhizomes pieces will feed through the transplanter openings. Follow planter manufacturer's directions or do test runs to determine what size rhizome pieces are best used for the variety, and or species to be planted.Planting Depth—Regardless of the type of planting equipment used, giant rhizomes should be planted between 2 and 4 inches deep.Planting Rate—Plant populations between 4,000 and 16,000 plants per acre have been evaluated. Higher numbers provide earlier canopy closure and weed control, but are more expensive to establish with relatively little improvements in long-term yield. However, year 1 and 2 establishment yields have shown improvement with the higher stand densities and require less overall weed control. The consensus among researchers is that the desired final population should be between 4,000 and 5,000 plants per acre. Since large rhizome (1.5-2 oz) survival usually averages 60 to 70 percent, this means 6,000 to 7,000 rhizomes per acre are needed to get the final recommended stand. The higher rate should be used for less optimum conditions (e.g., soils with lower water holding capacity, higher expected weed competition, late planting, etc.). With irrigation, establishment survival should be higher, and lower rates may be practical. However, the quality of the rhizome is important in any condition.Row Spacing—According to one recommendation, in the Midwest plant using 30-inch rows with 30-inch spacing between plants. This is based on two factors. One is the need to use up to 7,000 rhizomes per acre to get the desired final stand density, and the second is that research has shown that actually leaving equal space around each rhizome or plug gives better first season growth. Given variability in the planting equipment available, slight variations in the 30-by 30-inch spacing would be reasonable as long as plant population is maintainedPlanting Methods—Most research stands of giant have been established by hand planting rhizomes as space plants or by dropping rhizomes into furrows that were subsequently covered up. Broadcast planting followed by disking in and packing was the earliest mechanical method of planting rhizome pieces, but issues with consistent planting depth and the need for tillage to control weeds prompted the modification and use of standard row planting equipment.Modified corn drills and potato planters have been used to plant rhizomes, and vegetable or tobacco planters have been used for transplants or plugs. European and American equipment manufacturers have actively been modifying and/or developing planting equipment to plant both rhizome pieces and transplants.Table 1 lists some of the manufactures advertising specialized giant planting equipment for the United States or Canadian market in 2011. In the case of rhizomes, the field should be rolled after planting to ensure good soil contact and few air spaces unless otherwise directed by the planter manufacturer. Irrigation is recommended after planting if transplants or plugs are used, and additional applications may be warranted the first growing season. If available, irrigation also may be warranted to speed the establishment and, thus, first-year survival of rhizome-planted field.Despite these advances in the art of cultivation, there remains a need for improved machinery and processes for retrieving rhizomes from mature plants, processing them to produce suitable planting stock, and re-planting the rhizome planting stock in fields.Table 2 indicates various known density adjustments per acre associated with row and plant spacing.Despite these advances in the art of cultivation, there remains a need for improved machinery and processes for retrieving rhizomes from fields in which they have grown. A preferred planter is disclosed in our co-pending application entitled “Planter for Rhizomes and the like” Ser. No. 14/170,572, filed on Feb. 1, 2014. A preferred processor is disclosed in our co-pending application entitled “Processor for Rhizomes and the like” Ser. No. 14/170,578, filed on Feb. 1, 2014. The disclosures of those two applications are incorporated herein by reference. The present invention is advantageously used in combination with those two inventions, but they are not required.The present invention fulfills one or more of these needs in the art by providing an apparatus for harvesting rhizomes from a field of soil in which rhizome-bearing plants have grown. The apparatus is typically used after harvesting the bio mass stock growing above ground. A chassis having wheels moves in a primary direction over an area of the field in which rhizome-bearing plants have grown, the primary direction defining a forward and aft sense.Coulter disks are mounted on a forward end of the chassis, with digger blade that can be set to varying depths, of 0 to 8 inches deep. Tines aft of the blade move forward and backward to loosen debris before entering an incline. An inclined ramp on the chassis has a live bottom mounted to move clusters of rhizomes up the ramp in the aft direction including upright posts that move over the live bottom to catch and push the clusters of rhizomes up the inclined ramp. The ramp has superstructure bars extending above the live bottom that have obstructers extending downward from the superstructure bars toward the live bottom. A collector aft of the live bottom collects rhizomes falling from an aft end of the inclined ramp. As the chassis moves over the field of rhizome-bearing plants, the coulter disks break up soil on a top surface of the field, the digger blades scoop clusters of rhizomes from the field with adhered soil, the upright posts on the live bottom catch and push clusters of rhizomes and soil up the inclined ramp and as clusters encounter the obstructers, the cluster is broken to reduce its size and to loosen and separate soil from the rhizomes, and the rhizomes are collected by the collector.In a preferred embodiment the live bottom includes endless chains on left and right sides of the live bottom and a drive mechanism to drive the chains in endless paths parallel to one another at left and right sides of the live bottom. The cross-members connect the endless chains across the live bottom, and the upright posts are mounted on at least some of the cross-members that move over the live bottom as the endless chains are driven. Typically, the upright posts are spaced apart from one another and the obstructers are spaced apart from one another. As the upright posts move upward on the inclined ramp, as least some of the upright posts pass between the obstructers, so that rhizome clusters being pushed by the upright posts impact the obstructers. The obstructers may have sharpened edges facing the forward direction so that they can divide rhizome clusters into smaller clusters.The collector may include a second inclined ramp extending from the chassis and having a live bottom mounted to move rhizomes up the second inclined ramp including upright posts that move over the live bottom of the second ramp to catch and push rhizomes up the second inclined ramp to allow the rhizomes to be dropped into a transport container.The tines may have an aft end that is pivotally mounted to the chassis. Agitators for the tines mounted on the chassis move the front ends of the tines forward and backward by pivoting about the pivotal mount at the aft end of the tines as the chassis moves over the field of rhizome-bearing plants.The chassis may have a hitch to enable the apparatus to be pulled over the field of rhizome-bearing plants, such as by a tractor. The chassis may have a forwardly-extending rotatable shaft to connect to a power take-off on a tractor and mechanical linkages from the shaft to drive the live bottom to move the rhizomes up the ramp.The invention can also be considered as a method of harvesting rhizomes from a field of soil in which rhizome-bearing plants have grown. The method includes breaking up soil on a top surface of the field, scooping clusters of rhizomes from the field with adhered soil, catching the clusters of scooped rhizomes on a mechanism that pushes the clusters of rhizomes to a location where the clusters of rhizomes encounter obstructers that reduce the size of the cluster and loosens and separates soil from the cluster of rhizomes, and collecting the reduced-size clusters of rhizomes.The obstructers and the mechanism that pushes the clusters of rhizomes typically cooperate to force the reduction in size of the clusters of rhizomes. The obstructers may cut the clusters. Catching and pushing the clusters of rhizomes includes pushing the clusters up a slope, so that separated soil can fall back down the slope to return to the field.Collecting the reduced-size clusters of rhizomes may include pushing the clusters up a second slope, so that separated soil can fall back down the slope to return to the field. Pushing the clusters up a second slope may includes pushing the clusters up a perforated slope so separated soil can fall through the perforations to return to the field.plants grow with rhizomes underground. The rhizomes proliferate and branch from one another as the plant grows, forming a large cluster of stick-like pieces. It is desirable to retrieve the clusters of rhizomes from mature plants and to break them up to form starting material for new plants in plant propagation. The rhizomes will have developed naturally as the plant grows, forming an intricate network that is interleaved with the soil in which the plant is growing, forming a secure grasp of the plant on the soil. Thus to retrieve the cluster of rhizomes requires specialized equipment to be described.is a plan view of a preferred embodiment of a digger for rhizomes. The apparatus  includes a forward part  which can be acquired from Bartschi-Fobro A.G., Bernstrasse 26, CH-6152 Huswil, Switzerland (fobro.com). The Fobro apparatus includes a tow yoke  and a coulter disk  mounted on a chassis , that also includes digger blades, not shown in . Rearward of the Fobro unit  is a mechanism  that includes an inclined ramp with a live bottom to raise dug-up clusters, reduce them in size, and knock dirt from them. The clusters travel up the inclined ramp  and are dropped into a second inclined ramp , where further dirt removal takes place, and the clusters are dropped into an adjoining truck or other container (not shown).  shows that the overall direction of travel of the apparatus is in the direction of the arrow A at the bottom of the Figure.is a front side perspective view of the apparatus, with the second inclined ramp  pivoted to be substantial parallel with the first inclined ramp  to make a more compact apparatus to travel over the road. In addition, rear wheels  of the second inclined ramp are shown raised, to allow the apparatus to travel over the road. The base of the second ramp is raised to elevate the wheels . A support bracket  can be included to allow the second inclined ramp  to be lowered onto it for additional support during over the road transport of the mechanism.shows the tow yoke  of the Fobro apparatus . The coulter disks  are formed on a drum that is journaled in the bearings in the bottom of a height adjustment apparatus, and hydraulic cylinders  raise and lower the yoke , as needed. A power take off shaft  extends forwardly of the Fobro chassis  to connect it to a power take off fitting on a towing tractor. The chassis  is provided with wheels  to allow the apparatus to run smoothly over a field, and on a road. Shown to the rear of the Fobro chassis  is the first inclined ramp .Referring now to , a different view of the apparatus is seen, from the left front of the apparatus. The Fobro digger blades  are seen more clearly in , along with a shaker apparatus . The coulter disks  cut through crop residue and divide the soil along lines in the direction of travel to cause divisions laterally and break any hard crust on the surface of the soil. The blades  extend down into the soil to scoop up clusters of rhizomes. The blades lift the root mass material, and an attached head moves the blade in a forward and back motion at a depth of 2 to 8 inches to cut rootmass material evenly. To the rear of the blades, tines are oscillated by the shaker . This shaking movement causes considerable amount of the soil otherwise adhered to the rhizome cluster to fall away and stay in the field from which the rhizomes are being collected. As rhizomes are dug by the blades , newly dug rhizome clusters push previously dug rhizome clusters rearward, where they can be engaged by an endless chain component of the first inclined ramp.The first inclined ramp  has a sloping bottom  that allows dirt to slide back down the bottom  under the influence of gravity on the incline . Trained around sprockets  and a sprocket attached to hydraulic motor  is a chain . A similar chain and sprocket assembly on the other side of the ramp  is positioned substantially parallel with the chain . Slats  span between links of the chain  and the chain on the other side. Selected ones of the slats  have upright posts  mounted on them. As clusters of rhizomes exit the rear of the tines, one or more travelling posts  engage with the cluster to push and carry the cluster up the inclined ramp .Spaced above the inclined ramp  is a frame  having downwardly extending obstructors . Preferably the obstructors  are shaped with a leading knife edge, and are staggered across the width of the ramp , so that as the posts  travel up the ramp, they pass between the obstructors . Clusters of rhizomes traveling on the post  encounter the obstructors . The force of the post  pressing the clusters against the obstructer  will tend to cut or break the cluster of rhizomes into a smaller cluster. Also, dirt that has been adhering to the cluster will be dislodged and be allowed to fall onto the bottom  to fall back to the ground. Vibration resulting from operation of the device may also shake dirt from the cluster and aid its descent down the bottom . The clusters then continue up over the top of the ramp  past the hydraulic motor .From there the reduced-size clusters fall into a second conveyor  having one end journaled on a sprocket , and the other journaled with a drive motor . The conveyor  is perforated, preferably an open weave chain, so that additional dirt can fall through the conveyor to fall on the ground as the clusters travel up the conveyor  to be discharged past the motor . Typically, a truck travels alongside the apparatus, and the clusters fall from the ramp  into the bed of the truck. The drive motor  is provided with power through a connected shaft  connecting back through by linkages which can be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art to the power take off shaft .shows another view of the deployed apparatus, showing an outrigger with tire  to help provide balance for the cantilevered second ramp .The mechanisms to cause the various movements described herein are well known to those who are skilled in the art and can be devised from the description set forth herein. Power sources other than the power take off of a tractor can be used, such as hydraulic motors, electric motors and the like.Certain modifications and improvements will occur to those skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description. It should be understood that all such modifications and improvements have been omitted for the sake of conciseness and readability, but are properly within the scope of the following claims."
